From [Mashable](http://web.archive.org/web/20120324204033/http://mashable.com/2012/03/21/non-profits-digital-infographic/):

> “On April 5, M+R Strategic Services, a public relations and communications firm working with leading non-profits, and the Nonprofit Technology Network (NTEN), a membership organization of non-profit professionals who use technology for their causes, will release their sixth annual [eNonprofit Benchmarks Study](http://web.archive.org/web/20120324204033/http://www.e-benchmarksstudy.com/) of what is working today in online advocacy, fundraising and social networking. The study is based on primary research with 44 participating non-profits, including the AARP, American Red Cross, Human Rights Watch, Planned Parenthood and the World Wildlife Fund. All of the non-profits covered fall under the categories of environmental, international, human rights, wildlife, animal welfare and other causes. The 2011 study can be downloaded [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20120324204033/http://labs.mrss.com/check-out-our-enonprofit-benchmarks-study-infographic-and-get-the-full-report/).”

It’s an interesting infographic, showing fundraising innovations and trends across the sector. Will be interesting to see what the full report contains when it’s released on April 5th.
