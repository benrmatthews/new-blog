Our lives are spent looking though small windows.

For many, this is mainly because we are in lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. All I often see of the outside world is looking out though the windows of my home.

But we spend our work time looking through the window of a laptop.

Even none-work time is often spent browsing through the window of a smartphone.

Because life is spent looking through small windows, I worry I’m living a small life.

For example, I’m regularly concerned that I worry more about getting to inbox zero than getting further on more interesting life projects.

And getting to inbox zero is another small window, but this one less physical and more time-based, as the window between getting to inbox zero and receiving another email is very small.

How can we live a large life while living and working through small windows?

* The internet is the largest enabler here. Through the internet, I can live a larger life by:

  Visiting new places by watching videos on Youtube (or even using street view on Google Maps)

  Discovering how other’s have lived by reading bios on Wikipedia

  Understanding how others view life by visiting subreddits on various topics (current favourites: )

  Keeping up with friends and family through messages, email and video calls

  Exploring my own ways of thinking and sharing them publicly for others to read and comment on using article like this

  Learning new skills through tutorials, guides,videos and seeing how others clear  - I’m currently learning to play the trumpet, manly through watching YouTube videos

The common thread throughout these examples is that they enable us to live life outside of our small windows.

The insights gained as things learned inline are best used to build relationships, develop skills, grow our understanding of and help us to explore the world around us - when we are our living in it and not confined by our laptops and smartphones.

Despite the above, I still worry that I‘m living a small life.\

If there’s one thing the Covid-19 pandemic has taught me it’s that life is not well lived by looking through small windows, but by engaging in the world you can see through them.
