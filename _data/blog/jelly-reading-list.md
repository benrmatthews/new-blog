Jelly is the new iPhone and Android app from Twitter co-founder, [Biz Stone](http://twitter.com/biz "Biz Stone").

The basic premise is of “loosely distributed networks of people coordinating via Jelly to help each other.” Here’s their video to explain more:

I’ve been playing around with the app this morning and found the experience a mix of Instagram and Quora. You post a photo and ask a question to go with that photo. Other people can then answer your question and link out to sites that support their answer.

Playing around with Jelly, I asked “What are the essential sites or newsletters to subscribe to?”

I thought it would be useful to share the list in case there’s anything new, interesting or useful for you.

**“What are the essential sites or newsletters to subscribe to?”**
