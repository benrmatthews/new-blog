Finding freelance jobs online can be a difficult task, but with the proliferation of online jobs sites you’ll never be stuck for options for finding freelance work online.

I’ve compiled this list of 21 freelance job sites, covering everything from web design and IT contracts to photography projects, graphic design to copywriting jobs.

While you will want to build up your own network, referrals and repeat business, these freelance job sites can help you build up your experience and get you used to the ins and outs of working as a freelancer.

Each entry has a link to the job site and a brief description. I plan to return to the list and update it with further details, like how much the typical project pays and which areas / countries the freelance jobs tend to come from for each job site, but I hope this is a good start and is useful for those looking to find freelance jobs online.

These lists include sites where you bid for projects, as well as job sites and forums. For sites where you bid for projects, the sites often take a commission – usually a percentage of the project fee. In case of forums, you get the ability to contact the client directly and work out a project fee from there.
