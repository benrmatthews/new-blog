![late payment](http://benrmatthews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/late-payment.jpg)

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this post I’d like to share with you my list of the top four resources you can use to tackle late payment. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s based on my own research, combined with the insight I’ve gained from working with our users (to date over 80,000 of them). I hope you’re able pick up some great new tips and tools. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The list is by no means exhaustive, so if you think I’ve missed anything essential please do let me know in the comments section below! </span>

**Resource 1 – A Quality Invoice Template**
-------------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A quality invoice template is a crucial first step when it comes to late payment. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Where’s the best place to find one?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I know I’m biased, but I’ve actually made a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">free invoice template</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> myself. It comes in both Word and Excel, and is specifically for sole traders (it’s been downloaded over 7,000 times). Other great templates, in different designs and colour schemes, are available [here](http://benrmatthews.com/free-freelance-invoice-templates-generators/)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that whatever template you go for, it should definitely include the following:</span>

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">All relevant contact information (both yours and your clients).</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Payment terms, the due date, and your bank details (all clearly visible).</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Products/ services being invoiced (along with a detailed description of these).</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Any additional information required by your client eg. a purchase order number.</span>

**Resource 2 – Blog Posts and Articles on Late Payment**
--------------------------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reading about what other people in a similar situation have done is always a good source of information. Though when it comes to late payment the number of articles out there is, quite frankly, a little overwhelming.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to worry!! I’ve trawled through a fair chunk of them, and made a shortlist of what I think are the best ones:</span>

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Katý Cowan (founding editor of Creative Boom) has a great </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">9 step guide</span>](http://www.creativeboom.com/tips/how-to-prevent-late-payment-from-clients/)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> on how freelancers can prevent late payment. It covers all the basics, and is a great intro on the subject. </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">WikiHow’s</span>](http://www.wikihow.com/Prevent-Late-Payments-from-Customers)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> post also covers all the essentials.</span>

- [<span style="font-weight: 400;">Freelance Fees Guide</span>](http://www.londonfreelance.org/feesguide/index.php?&section=Welcome&subsect=All&subsubs=All)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> has a handy “General Advice” section covering issues on late payment, and industry relevant information for different types of freelancers.</span>

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re feeling a bit frustrated or annoyed by a late paying client then it’s time to watch </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Monteiro’s presentation</span>](https://vimeo.com/22053820)<span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s a 40 minute presentation on late payment in the world of freelancing, packed with advice and inspiration (as well as the odd four word expletive).</span>

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re after stats or info on the subject there’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a great survey done by the Federation for Small Businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (the FSB). It’s from 2011, so perhaps a little old for 2016, but it still drills down into the data quite well.</span>

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re after fresher data I suggest creating </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Google alerts</span>](https://www.google.com/alerts)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> for phrases such as “late payment uk” and “freelancer late payment”. That way you can get regular updates on what is going on. There are new statistics and reports published almost daily!</span>

**Resource 3 – Freelancer Forums**
----------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As well as specific posts dealing with late payment there’s a whole host of knowledge to be gained from online forums, where you get advice “straight from the horse’s mouth”. Here’s a few I recommend taking a look at:</span>

- [<span style="font-weight: 400;">UKBF</span>](http://www.ukbusinessforums.co.uk/)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> (UK Business Forums). Plenty of threads on the issue of late payment. Most are found under the “Legal” section in the “Running a Business” category. You can also use the search bar to look for a specific term. Worth checking often as new contributions are added on a regular basis.</span>

- [<span style="font-weight: 400;">Freelance UK</span>](http://www.freelanceuk.com/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Same as UKBF but more niche and relevant to freelancers. Simply type “late payment” in the search bar for relevant results. Last I checked there were around four pages worth of information.</span>

**Resource 4 – Legal Advice**
-----------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sounding out where you stand from a legal perspective on late payment is vital. Offending clients often try to play on a freelancer’s lack of legal knowledge. Here’s a few good (and crucially, free!) resources to get you started:</span>

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lovetts have a good </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">introductory article</span>](https://www.lovetts.co.uk/blogs/Claiming-Late-Payment-Interest-and-Compensation.aspx)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> on claiming late payment interest and compensation. They explain the ins and outs of the Late Payment of Commercial Debts Act.</span>

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Government has </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">a good section</span>](https://www.gov.uk/late-commercial-payments-interest-debt-recovery/when-a-payment-becomes-late)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> on its site covering some of the legal basics.</span>

- [<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Law Donut</span>](http://www.lawdonut.co.uk/law/contracts-disputes/debt-recovery/interest-on-late-payments)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> explains in a clear and concise manner how much interest you can charge.</span>

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Rocket Lawyer have a comprehensive </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">free tools section</span>](https://www.rocketlawyer.co.uk/legal-centres/debt-recovery.rl)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, including late payment letter templates and letters before action. They’re all free to download!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And there you have it. That’s my list of the top four resources for tackling late payment when freelancing. I certainly hope you found it useful. Feel free to add any thoughts or comments below. And by all means send me an email (</span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">john.hills@zervant.com</span>](mailto:john.hills@zervant.com)<span style="font-weight: 400;">) or a tweet ([@zervant](http://twitter.com/zervant)).
