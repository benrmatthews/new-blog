### <span id="What_is_Hello_Bonsai">**What is Hello Bonsai?**</span>

Hello Bonsai isn’t strictly accounting software, though we did include it in our best online accounting software review roundup.

Hello Bonsai is an all-around suite of tools designed with freelancers in mind. It’s got a host of great features, including project management, billing document creation, time tracking, and more.

Unlike some other options, like [Freshbooks](https://www.freshbooks.com/) or [Quickbooks](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/uk/), [Hello Bonsai](https://app.hellobonsai.com/users/aff_sign_up?fp_ref=ben15) is intuitive and easy to use.

Hello Bonsai’s founder Matt Brown said he built it to “make that annoying and confusing contract for freelance dev and design work easier to create, understand, and sign.”

Matt’s hope is that Hello Bonsai helps build better relationships with clients and gives you one less thing to worry about when freelancing.

The main use cases for Hello Bonsai are two things:

- Generating contracts; and
- Automating invoicing;

You can even send your clients automated reminders to help you get paid faster.

There other things Bonsai is legitimately great at, such as basic accounting, creating proposals and tracking your hours, but some freelancers have found better [freelance tools](https://benrmatthews.com/freelance-tools/).

- Freelancers and small business may find more complete accounting packages elsewhere

“The best part of it all: you can send a W-9 to clients. Having that on board will be so helpful during tax season!” – So Am I Write

“Hello Bonsai is a really great tool for freelancers and agencies. You can keep all your project’s contracts and billing in one place.” – Crafting Hands

“After you have your contract templates set up, it’s just a few clicks and your contract is on its way to your client’s inbox. And after sending my clients their contracts and invoices, most of them (if not all) signed and paid their deposit *the next day*.” – Molly
