### **What is Freshbooks?**

[FreshBooks](https://www.freshbooks.com/) is one of the most established freelancing accounting software in the market today, having been founding back in January 2003, by the owner of a design agency who was frustrated that when it came to billing clients, Word and Excel were difficult to use and weren’t built to create professional looking invoices.

Getting start with Freshbooks is easy. Most people send their first invoice seconds after starting their free trial.

“FreshBooks has allowed me to free up time and focus on growing my business. Thank you!” – Deric

![Quickbooks Accounting Software](../uploads/2018/11/Quickbooks-Accounting-Software.png)

- 30-day free trial
- From $15/month
- Sign up at [quickbooks.com](https://www.quickbooks.com/)

### **What is Quickbooks?**

[Quickbooks](https://www.quickbooks.com/) has been around for a long time, first as a desktop version and now as online accounting software.

Quickbooks have heavily invested in their AI and automation features to help you quickly tag and categorise your invoices and expenses so you can see what you’re really making and spending

Connecting QuickBooks to your bank account and credit card accounts, and let QuickBooks do the work for you. You’ll eliminate tons of data entry, and your books will always be up to date and accurate.

For expenses, QuickBooks fills in who you paid and what it was for. You can change this information if you need to. This is where QuickBooks starts to help you out. It can find other expenses that look like the one you just added, and assign them all the same category.

QuickBooks can also automatically categorise client payments to a sales account. If QuickBooks isn’t sure about a category for an expense, it’ll leave it as uncategorized. You can pick a category or choose Ask My Accountant to file it away to go over with your accountant later.

QuickBooks lets you know if you have any expenses that need to be reviewed. As you categorize more expenses, QuickBooks learns from you so it can help. A transaction in green means QuickBooks recognizes that you categorized a similar transaction in the past. So it automatically assigns the same category for you.

Reports like the profit and loss report show you more detail about how your expenses are categorized. You can even see your expenses as a percentage of your income. This is very helpful in understanding where your money is going.

You can even explore QuickBooks for yourself with a [free product test drive](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/how-it-works).

### **QuickBooks Features**

- Automates standard bookkeeping tasks such as entering transactions, performing calculations, and organizing data to keep your books balanced.

- Track your bills and their due dates in one place so that you always pay on time and avoid late fees.
- Set up automatic payments so that your bills are paid for you
- Use the QuickBooks app to turn your phone’s camera into a receipt scanner. Snap a photo of a receipt and QuickBooks will attach it to the expense in your books
- Create custom, professional business reports, access your balance sheet, cash flow statement, income statement, and over 50 other reports
- Create professional estimates and quotes for a prospective customer
- Create invoices and get paid fast via credit card, debit card, Apple Pay, and more

“I’ve been a QuickBooks user for a lot of years and was very pleased when the online version became available. I’ve had a couple of hiccups and the initial response wasn’t particularly impressive. However, when I eventually got connected to the right person in Technical Support, I have to say, I couldn’t fault his commitment to sorting out my issues.” – Sean

What features does the best online accounting software have?
------------------------------------------------------------

There are plenty of other options out there, but these picks meet a couple of critical criteria:

- **Avaikable online 24/7:** Back when accounting software was desktop-based, you need costly servers and other infrastructure that you are unlikely to have. Thankfully today most accounting software is cloud-based software, which means you can work from any device – mobile, tablet or desktop – at any time, and you don’t have to take care of any of the website hosting or any upgrades that might be needed – it’s all handled by the accounting software
- **Integration with banks:** By automatically connecting to your business banking, you are increasing thr accuracy of the data passed between your accounting software and your bank. Even better, you’re saving massive amounts of time compared to entering data manually or fixing mistakes if you find you’ve added something to the system incorrectly .
- **Easy to understand dashboards and reports:** The best online accounting software helps you manage income and expenses in such a way that it is easy to see how your business is performing at a glance and report to any governmental departments, such as HMRC in the UK and the IRS in the US. This is why a personal financial tracking system like Mint doesn’t work for a freelance business—you need to track and report on your financials with recognized business accounting best practices.
- **Low cost and scalable monthly fees:** Each of these online accounting software services provide a low cost starting monthly fee which is more than workable for a freelancer or small business that are just starting up. You can then scale and access more complicated features once your business is established and you can afford the higher fees.
- **Professional Support from trained accountants:** if there is  a time when you need help with your accounting, then these online accounting software choices provide much needed support, either internally from their own accountants, or by linking you up with external bookkeepers and business consultants. Don’t use a system that nobody is going to be able to help you with – you’ll need someone to turn to when you need help with you books!
- Mobile Apps: Being able to snap an expense or check on the invoice while on the move is getting increasingly valuable as our phones get more and more powerful. While not a deal breaker, using accounting software with a powerful and integrated mobile app will help make your work life easier when you’re away from the office.

Which is the best online accounting software for you?
-----------------------------------------------------

The best online accounting software for you depends on where you are in your freelance journey and how you’ve set up your small business.

Just [starting out as a freelance consutlant](https://benrmatthews.com/freelance-consultant/) or small business? Try [Hello Bonsai](https://app.hellobonsai.com/users/aff_sign_up?fp_ref=ben15).

Lots of clients and invoices, for example a design studio that has a high turnover of projects? Use [Freshbooks](https://www.freshbooks.com/).

And if you have grown to the point where you are ready for an accountant or bookkeeper, choose Quickbooks – it’s a powerful tool but needs an accountant to help make the most of it.

Whichever of these options is the best online accounting software for you, you can feel confident that you have the best [freelance tools](https://benrmatthews.com/freelance-tools/) to keep your freelance finances in order so that you can and get back to the [freelance work](https://benrmatthews.com/find-freelance-work-quickly-new-freelance-consultant/) you love.
