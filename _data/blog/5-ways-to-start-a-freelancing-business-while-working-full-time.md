Experts advise entrepreneurs not to quit their jobs first until they are assured that the business venture will bear fruits. You might run out of resources to keep the business going before it becomes profitable.

It gets more demanding if you are still holding another full-time job. It is, therefore, a delicate balancing act that requires a strategy. Here are five ways and tricks on how to start the freelancing business while still holding a fulltime job.

**Remain In The Line Of Your Skills**
-------------------------------------

Choose a niche that is within the realm of your current skill set. It takes a lot of time and effort to learn new skills while still holding a fulltime job. The challenge is that you might not meet the expectations of your clients because you have bitten more than you can handle.

A familiar area of operation allows you to transition seamlessly. You will also understand the processes that go into serving customers or establishing the business. Customer service will not be a surprise when you discover that there was more to the business than you thought.

A business you are familiar with also helps you to build more realistic expectations. These expectations bring satisfaction because you will have achieved the desired goals with little struggle. Familiarity helps you to make realistic projections, allocate reasonable time, and have a better grip on your business.

**Fill The Void That Your Current Business Is Not Filling**
-----------------------------------------------------------

Employees always see voids that their employers are unable to fill. These voids are filled by other companies that are not related to your current full-time employer. Such opportunities are perfect for freelancers to take up and turn into thriving businesses.

The [transition from a fulltime employee into a freelancer](https://www.plugandplaytechcenter.com/resources/startup-business-ideas/) is perfect when you spot an opportunity. The current clients will also appreciate the fact that you are known to them already and have served them in another capacity. This will give you a head-start when looking for new clients.

For instance, you may realize that your employer at the warehouse is not offering delivery services. Take the opportunity and invest in a truck. You can hire a driver in the meantime before you have a large fleet that is enough to warrant you to quit the full-time job. Completing the cycle of needs for your clients gives you a solid start.

**Utilize Your Free Time During The Day**
-----------------------------------------

An entrepreneur needs all the time available to set up his or her business. The startup process involves learning new skills, knowing your customers, setting up structures, and polishing your product, among other duties. You still have to commit fully to your 8-5 job to avoid loss of revenue.

An employee enjoys several hours free each working day. It could be the early morning minutes before you begin work at your office. You also have tea and lunch breaks to use as you wish. The time can be used to contact clients, tighten your business plan, and build relationships.

Do not waste time or feel guilty that you are spending time wrongly at work. While you work from the office, ensure that it does not interfere with your performance. Bosses should also not know that you are engaged in other businesses because they will be jittery about your loyalty. Be discreet about any activities you will be undertaking besides your responsibilities at work.

**Work On Night Shift**
-----------------------

Do you have an option to work the night shift? Take the option as a sacrifice to set up your business. If you are not allowed to take straight or continuous nightshifts, you have to utilize the few chances available to set up your business.

Taking the night shift gives you a free day to set up and interact better with your clients. Most of the clients might be away during early mornings and evenings, such that you cannot reach them at night. However, the night shift means that you will be available when most of the clients are available.

**Make It Digital** 
--------------------

Businesses running on a digital platform are easier to set up and run while you are still holding a full-time job. You serve your customers from the website or phone, meaning that the commitment will not be as demanding. Digital platforms also come with auto-response options where most concerns from your customers can be addressed without requiring your physical presence.

Digital businesses reduce the need for you to be physically present. Automated viewing of goods, payment, order for delivery, and such other procedures mean that you can still concentrate on your fulltime job. You will only need a few hours at the end of the day or early in the morning for logistics.

Digital businesses still require time and commitment. The idea that a business is digital does not mean that you will not commit time and resources. You have to work hard behind the scenes to ensure that the automated activities still run without your direct involvement.

**Making Freelancing A Success**
--------------------------------

The success of a freelancing business depends on how well you research and set up your activities. Design your structure in such a way that you will not be required to commit much time or the little time available will be enough to keep the business running. Use technology to your advantage in automating your operations.

Successful freelancing requires an entrepreneur with clear goals. The goals will help you understand the resource requirements, time, and how you can still serve clients without losing focus on your full-time job. Establish a routine and reorganize your work schedule at work so that you do not lose your job and still fail in your freelancing venture. You have to sacrifice a lot of time and additional resources to actualize your freelancing venture while still working full time.
