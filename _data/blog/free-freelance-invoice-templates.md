Presenting yourself as a professional freelance consultant is important and there’s no better chance to give this impression than when invoicing your client, as it’s a great chance to [finish your freelance project on a high](https://freetrain.co/finish-freelance-projects-high/ "Finish freelance projects on a high with these 8 client pleasers").

There are loads of [free invoice templates](https://freetrain.co/product/freelance-invoice-template/) and generators out there, but which ones are the best for you?

Do you want a slick, professional looking invoice for your freelance business, but will be encouraged to sign up to other premium freelance services?

Or do you just want to generate a basic freelance invoice, using an [editable invoice template](https://freetrain.co/product/freelance-invoice-template/), without being sold to while you create your freelance invoice?

I’ve looked through the options available online to help you create a professional looking freelance invoice – for free.

*(Where possible, I’ve listed if the invoice generators are completely free or if a paid freelance service is behind the site. If I’m wrong in any case, or you’ve spotted one I should add, then let me know!)*

<span id="Download_the_freelance_contract_template">Download the [free invoice template](https://freetrain.co/product/freelance-invoice-template/)</span>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not got much time and just want to download an editable version of the freelance invoice template?

[Download the freelance invoice template (free)](https://freetrain.co/product/freelance-invoice-template/)

FreeTrain’s free editable invoice template
------------------------------------------

FreeTrain’s range of sleek, [simple invoice templates](https://freetrain.co/product/freelance-invoice-template/) are created especially for freelancers, contractors and small business owners.

[Invoice to me](http://invoiceto.me/)
-------------------------------------

![Invoice to me](http://benrmatthews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-06-at-16.01.32-720x479.png)

One of the free invoice generators that doesn’t seem to be trying to sell you another service, Invoice To Me lets you create and send professional looking PDF invoices online. Plus it automatically calculates taxes and totals for you.

Simple and free, with no advertising or attempts to upgrade you to a paid service, which is quite refreshing after looking through the others.

Invoice At Once
---------------

![Invoice at once](http://benrmatthews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-06-at-16.10.42-720x357.png)

InvoiceAtOnce.com is a 100% free, no registration needed online invoice generator for freelancers.

You don’t need an account and it comes with added features compared to Invoice To Me. For example, you can upload your company logo, choose currency, types and colours.

Probably the nicest looking freelance invoice template and they’re not trying to upgrade you to another freelance service, although the site does carry advertising.

![Paydirt's free invoice generator](http://benrmatthews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-06-at-16.06.16-720x388.png)

A freelance invoice generator that’s so good, it even makes one of their freelance clients “not hate invoicing”.

Much the same as the other freelance invoice generators, but you can upgrade to the full Paydirt app and it will help you to track payments, accept credit cards, and be automatically notified of late invoices.

A great feature is that Paydirt can create invoices in <span class="tooltip">47 currencies</span> and <span class="tooltip">16 languages.</span> Need to send a Rechnung, or a Facture? Paydirt has got you covered.
