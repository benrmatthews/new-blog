[Last week’s post on Tech For Good](http://benrmatthews.com/tech-for-good-rise-movement/) got a good reception, both from those already working in the area and those who hadn’t heard of it, but maybe only needed a small nudge to start to join the pieces together and see them as the start of a movement.

There’s been a few more happenings over the last week and some initiatives people sent me after reading my post, so thought I’d follow up last week’s post with an update on all things Tech For Good.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[This post](http://www.mobilisationlab.org/product-teams-the-next-wave-of-digital-for-ngos/) from Greenpeace’s excellent Mobilisation Lab team picked up perfectly on some of the thoughts I’d had around how digital products differ from online services and how nonprofits generally aren’t geared up for this way of working.

> *“We’ve reached a fascinating point in the evolution of technology within nonprofit and social change organisations: everyone we work with at Greenpeace and beyond seems to agree that digital has a critical role to play, but many struggle to find the staffing models and structures that enable their technology to truly thrive.”*

The article looks at how organisations s can apply “product” principles to start and continue deliver the best technology for their cause. It’s a big topic, but the article does a great job of covering some of the background, strategies, ways to implement product teams and some of the pitfalls to look out for.

[![digital product teams](https://img.readitlater.com/i/www.mobilisationlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/MobLab-ProductTeams-DistributedOwnership5/RS/w704.png)](http://www.mobilisationlab.org/product-teams-the-next-wave-of-digital-for-ngos/)

I recommend reading the full post for an idea of just what it’s going to take to put a digital product team in place in charities that are traditionally used to working with content teams that use digital channels to promote their campaigns.

If you’re thinking of building digital products for your cause, the post is well worth a read and saving for later. I have a feeling you’ll be referring back to the post and points made as you make the journey into putting together your digital product team.

No sooner had I hit publish on my Tech For Good post than NPC announced their [Digital Transformation programme](http://www.thinknpc.org/our-work/projects/digital-transformation/).

<div class="entry-content separator">NPC’s programme is designed to transform the way the social sector functions by supporting the adoption of digital technologies.

</div><div class="entry-content separator">> *“Digital technology can make changes to the fundamental architecture of the sector—making it easier for charities to integrate with others, collaborate and coordinate their activities and to put beneficiaries at the heart of service design and delivery—and to save money while doing it too.”*

</div><div class="entry-content separator">We’ve heard this kind of thing before, but the way they articulate the challenges involved echoes my thoughts, just in a more formally structured way:

</div>> <div class="entry-content separator">***Capacity:** organisations are learning how to apply digital technology to their own models, and so are not able yet to consider what digital could enable through infrastructure, collaboration, and data sharing.*
> 
> ***Funding:** investment is limited, and most funders lack the expertise to assess proposals from charities that contain a digital aspect.*
> 
> ***Expertise:** those designing and developing digital technologies are mainly in the private sector, where potential social applications are far from front of mind.*
> 
> </div>

<div class="entry-content separator">They’re also running two events to meet the great and the good of the Tech For Good world (plus the rest of us), so sign up to their events in London and Manchester in July:

- [TECH FOR GOOD: TRANSFORMING CHARITY SERVICES THROUGH DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY](http://www.thinknpc.org/events/tech-for-good-transforming-charity-services-through-digital-technology-manchester/ "Tech for good: Transforming charity services through digital technology (Manchester)")
- Manchester
- 06 July 2015

- [TECH FOR GOOD: TRANSFORMING CHARITY SERVICES THROUGH DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY](http://www.thinknpc.org/events/tech-for-good-transforming-charity-services-through-digital-technology-london/ "Tech for good: Transforming charity services through digital technology (London)")
- London
- 14 July 2015

Looks like NPC have put together a fantastic steering group too, so the programme is in safe hands.

There’s a new [Tech For Good](http://www.techforgood.global/blog/are-you-in-charge-of-your-digital-self/) video out that asks [“Are you in charge of your digital self?”](https://vimeo.com/128931382)

I’ve embedded the video below, but it’s also well worth reading [the accompanying blog post from Abby Schlageter](http://www.techforgood.global/blog/are-you-in-charge-of-your-digital-self/) that features more from the video’s main subject, [Sarah Gold](http://www.sarahtgold.co.uk/) – a designer who proposed The Alternet – and points to a whole host of related Tech For Good resources.

Those of you who clicked through to the Tech For Good website may notice that the domain name for the sire has changed from techforgood.tv to [techforgood.global](http://techforgood.global).

This change reflects the growing success for the project, which has moved beyond videos and into a [podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/tech-for-good-tv/id966166230?mt=2), as well as the usual [blog](http://www.techforgood.global/blog), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/techforgoodtv) and [Facebook](http://facebook.com/techforgood) profiles.

They even held an event yesterday as part of the [Web We Want Festival](https://webwewant.org/) at London’s Southbank Centre. Read Tech For Good Co-founder [Cassie Robinson’s take on how tech is doing good here](http://webwewant.southbankcentre.co.uk/blog/seven-ways-tech-doing-good-1439).

My role with the team is changing slightly, but I’m still involved and a big supporter of the project, so looking forward to seeing what Cassie and the team get up to with Tech For Good.
