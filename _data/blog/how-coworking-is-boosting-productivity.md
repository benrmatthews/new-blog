![Coworking is ideal for freelancers, start-ups and those who just thrive on collaboration](https://freetrain.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Coworking-is-ideal-for-freelancers-start-ups-and-those-who-just-thrive-on-collaboration.jpg)

Coworking is a relatively new phenomenon that involves workers from different backgrounds sharing the same office space.

Whether it be a deluxe office space in Mayfair or a quirky studio in Shoreditch, coworking spaces are popping up all over larger cities like London.

It is a viable alternative to traditional office environments, which can limit people from reaching their full potential.

These spaces allow people to collaborate in a shared environment, where ideas, knowledge, and equipment can be exchanged.

**Why coworking?**
------------------

Though the flexibility of working from home is appealing, this comes with various distractions that may seem insignificant initially, but impact long-term productivity.

Office Specialists [Cornerstone](https://www.cornerstoneofficesearch.com/) have stated that Coworking is:

> “ideal for sole traders, start-ups and those who just thrive on collaboration.”

You’ll receive all the tools necessary to function to your full capacity, in an environment that facilitates quality work.

As a cost-effective, productive alternative, coworking continues to gain popularity, but how exactly can it boost productivity?

**Flexibility**
---------------

What could be better than working whenever you want, from a location of your choice?

Conventional work environments are restrictive, requiring employees to work at times that are often unsuitable.

When given the freedom to work your own hours, it’s surprising how much more can be achieved.

You can operate within your comfort zone, providing relief from the rigid grasps of the 9-5 setup.

Happiness correlates with productivity, and if workers are offered flexibility, they’re more likely to be happy about their work situation.

**Power of Networking**
-----------------------

Coworking spaces are inhabited by a multitude of professionals from different working backgrounds.

Workers are exposed to a diverse range of skill sets, creating fantastic networking opportunities.

The chances are there will be someone in the room who can help you with areas outside your expertise, where mutually beneficial relationships can develop. I

f you receive help tackling areas of difficulty, more time is freed to focus on your core competencies, increasing productivity.

A coworking environment facilitates sharing of ideas too, which can bolster your quality of work, while expanding business operations.

**Creative Collaboration**
--------------------------

Working in [close contact with creative and innovative business people](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meghanbiro/2013/03/03/smart-leaders-and-the-power-of-collaboration/) is inspiring.

When your creativity receives a lift, you’ll gain a sense of empowerment, garner new perspectives, and absorb new information on your journey.

Creative collaboration facilitates progression, where a focus on continuous improvement will help you unlock your true potential.

**Amenities**
-------------

In a coworking environment, you can share resources like printers, whiteboards and projectors.

This is advantageous because you can leverage equipment you might otherwise not have access to.

Even when a conventional office does have the things you need, searching for amenities can eat into your productivity and affect your work output.

Coworking environments leverage useful devices, which can be utilized in a cost-effective fashion.

**Focus**
---------

Working from home or a conventional office environment can be very distracting.

Your home is usually associated with leisure, meaning your brain isn’t conditioned to focus in this environment.

It is easy to get distracted in the office too, especially when you start looking at ways to kill time, or fall into bad habits like talking with people you become familiar with.

Coworking embodies a [‘keep your head in the game’](https://talentegg.ca/incubator/2014/12/01/keeping-head-game-stay-focused-work/) approach, in an environment that’s designed to suit your work requirements.

**Sense of Urgency**
--------------------

In a coworking space that’s brimming with creativity, you’ll be motivated to work hard, following the blueprint laid out by those around you.

When independent workers are gathered together for independent projects, everyone is primed to focus on their tasks at hand.

This creates a sense of urgency where you’re incentivized to achieve goals in alignment with those around you.

You’ll consequently develop good habits, arriving at work everyday with an unprecedented ability to focus.

**Work / Life Balance**
-----------------------

When your working life and personal life intertwine, this can be a recipe for disaster.

It’s difficult to avoid merging the two when you work from home, which can create an ongoing, uphill battle where work never stops.

With a coworking environment, you can keep your work and personal life separate, commiting to an efficient work schedule in an environment that’s conducive to hard work.

This allows you to finish work in a reasonable time, while giving you time to unwind and enjoy your personal life.
