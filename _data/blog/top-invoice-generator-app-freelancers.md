Although freelancing allows for a more flexible schedule, control over clients, and the luxury of being your own boss, it’s not always as “free” as it may seem. Working as a self-employed individual means constantly hustling to build your empire. Taking on multiple projects while also acting as your own legal advisor, human resource leader, and chief accountant are just a few tasks a self-employed individual is responsible for.

Being responsible for these various roles, on top of trying to maintain a healthy work-life balance can cause an immense amount of stress. Arguably, one of the most grueling yet important aspects of freelancing is making sure your [invoices](http://www.invoicehome.com) are getting paid for the countless hours of work you are putting in. Keeping track of payments and staying financially organized can be difficult especially when you are dealing with multiple clients everyday. Thankfully, there are tools available that can help with the financial side of the freelance lifestyle.
