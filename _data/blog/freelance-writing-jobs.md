We’ve singled out 5 freelance writing jobs you can try out this very moment. Plus, we’ll tell you about sites where to get hired.

Sounds tempting, doesn’t it? Let’s get started then.

Blogging
--------

The easiest way to start is blogging. First, you can begin with your own blog. It will give you the opportunity to find your style, experiment and learn how to market yourself. However, you can later try writing blog posts for someone else. There are many bloggers who don’t have enough time to manage their blogs every day, so this can become your niche. Unfortunately, there’s one drawback: your work won’t be recognized. Still, if it’s not an issue – feel free to jump at such an opportunity.

[Problogger](https://problogger.com/) job board can help you have a good start, as here you can work with various bloggers, learn all the pitfalls of this profession, earn some considerable experience and certainly make some good money.

Essay Writing
-------------

If you were good at academic writing while getting your degree, this is a perfect solution for you. You can become an essay writer. This job particularly involves crafting custom papers for students all over the world. You satisfy your urge to do research and earn great money.

There are several ways to dive into the world of academic composing. You can start by asking your friends whether someone needs help with papers. You can join various platforms where students are looking for writers, like [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/q-Essay-Writer-jobs.html), [Uvocorp](https://www.uvocorp.com/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/stressays), etc.

Finally, you can get employed at various [essay writing services](https://legitwritingservices.com/), as they also offer part-time jobs.

Products, shows, services – people like reading feedback about everything. That is why there’s a niche of review writing.

From local to international companies, employers are looking for writers to tell about their business. You can start with product review writing for Amazon, Digital or others.

These days you can write reviews about anything: small cafes, famous hotels, or even a retail chain in your hometown. As the saying goes, the sky’s the limit.

Technical Writing

If you’re into structuring your words, organizing every single detail, technical writing is just what you need. You’ll be writing manuals, instructions, and how-to articles.

Tons of companies are looking for authors who have a knack for explaining things. As it turns out, it’s quite difficult to write about how something is done while being concise and straightforward.

Here are two great job boards that will help you find orders regarding technical writing: [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/) and [Constant Content](https://www.constant-content.com/).

You can find companies looking for writers to craft short fictional stories. You will receive the title and let your imagination run wild.

Companies are also looking for speech writing as well as script writing. While dealing with speech writing you can practice your convincing writing techniques. Whereas, script writing enables you to put yourself into film director’s shoes.

See? There’s so much to choose from. Just listen to your heart and feel what niche is speaking to you.
