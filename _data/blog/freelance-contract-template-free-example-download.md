This freelance contract template will give you the basics for getting a robust freelance contract in place for your freelance business. And there’s even a [free example contract to download.](https://freetrain.co/product/freelance-contract-template/)

<div><figure>![freelance contract template](https://freetrain.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/freelance-contract-template.png)</figure></div>Freelancing can be a risky business. Much of [the relationship between you and your client](http://benrmatthews.com/build-long-term-relationships-clients/) will come down to trust. But one practical way you can make things crystal clear up-front is signing a robust freelance contract.

Having a contract in place is not an absolute guarantee that there will be no disputes down the line, but it is a useful way of setting out key terms so that both parties have a clear understanding of the job in hand and an incentive not to misbehave.

Contracts come in various shapes and sizes, from agile two-page contracts to 15-page tomes with all the legal bells and whistles attached.

If you are on a [freelance job](http://freetrain.co/find-freelance-jobs-online/) for a large client, the client may produce their standard contract for you to sign.

Smaller clients will often ask you to produce your own freelance contract or simply rely on trust.

Either way, you should ensure that you enter into a contract each time that protects your rights, reduces risk and helps you keep your sanity.
