“For us freelancing means freedom. A few yearsago, we were at a point where the thought ofdoing the same thing in the same place fordecades of our lives felt stifling. One day, we finally decided to actually do something about it. We researched our options, found work online asfreelancers, sold everything we owned, andstarted our adventure as digital nomads. So far, we’ve been to over 40 cities in 17 countries andcan’t wait to see what the future holds.” -Erin B.&amp; Tannia S., Eff The Office, Remote.

A personal brand is valuable when establishingauthority as a freelancer and creating a long-lasting impression with clients.

Nowadays, every freelancer should have awebsite, especially if they work with clients remotely.

Why is personal branding so important? A clean, consistent brand communicates authority andprofessionalism to anyone looking at yourbusiness and will help you establish yourself as atrustworthy freelancer.

Some freelancers remain sole proprietors andopt to receive 1099s and work from a personalbank account.

You’re set up online, now where are you going toset up to work? Your physical workspace can impact your productivity, focus, andmotivation, so you should keep this top-of-mindwhen considering your jump to freelancing.

“I actually love using Facebook groups likeFreelancing Females, The Copywriter Club, andThe Denver Boss Babe Collective. Those aregroups that get it. They understand freelancingand running your own business and are verycollaborative. I also enjoy word of mouth. Thebest business is a referral, so I let some of thattake its course. In six months I’ve already hadthree or four referral offers.” – Laura B., Denver.

Freelancers can set up and managetheir own benefits and taxes, but it does take alittle extra research and work.

Freelancing is an incrediblyincredible independentundertaking, but you don’t have to do everythingalone.

Another sacrifice of freelancing is forgoingcompany-sponsored benefits.

Retirement planning isn’t reserved for the” employed, and you definitely don’tneed an employer to set up a 401(k) or IRA.Freelancers and self-employed folks have manyof the same options as those who work for acompany, such as the Roth IRA, SEP IRA, or self-employed 401(k).
