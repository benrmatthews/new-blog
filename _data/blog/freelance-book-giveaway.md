<div id="giveaway">![freelance book giveaway](http://benrmatthews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/freelance-book-giveaway.png)</div>I’ve teamed up with the lovely guys at [Crunch](http://crunch.co.uk/ "Crunch") accounting to give away 5 copies of my book, [Freelance in 30 Days](http://benrmatthews.com/freelance-in-30-days/ "Freelance in 30 Days: Get the confidence and knowledge to succeed at going freelance").

And the book giveaway is easy to enter!

Just leave your email address in the box below and I’ll draw 5 winners at random, after the draw closes on 31st January.

Everyone who signs up will also get my [free 7-day course on going freelance](https://benrmatthews.com/free-freelance-course/), giving you lots of free tips and advice, direct to your inbox.

What have you got to lose?

P.S. If you like the look of the book but can’t wait until the competition closes to get your hands on all that freelance advice, simply **use the promo code ‘bensfriend’** when you buy [Freelance in 30 Days](http://benrmatthews.com/freelance-in-30-days/ "Freelance in 30 Days: Get the confidence and knowledge to succeed at going freelance") and you’ll get ***20% off the asking price*.** What’s not to love about that?
