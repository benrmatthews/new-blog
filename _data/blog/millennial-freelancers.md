[![Millennial Freelancers: Why freelancing is the perfect career for millennials](https://freetrain.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Why-freelancing-is-the-perfect-career-for-millennials.png "Millennial Freelancers: Why freelancing is the perfect career for millennials")](http://shrsl.com/19w35)

Millennials are increasingly turning to freelancing – any why shouldn’t they?

Freelancing gives you the [flexibility and freedom](https://freetrain.co/why-freelance-flexibility-freedom-and-additional-income/) to work wherever and whenever you want, making it the perfect career for millennials.

That’s according to a new survey by [FreshBooks](http://shrsl.com/19w35), the[ online accounting software for freelancers](https://freetrain.co/best-online-accounting-software/), that found that <span>millennials don’t just work because they have to—they need to find meaning in their work.</span>

<span>**Are you a millennial?** </span>
---------------------------------------

<span>[Being a millennial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials) means you were born between 1981-1996, making you anywhere from 22 – 37 years old. It’s a pretty big age range, but there are some amazing stats about this demographic.</span>

<span> For example, 56% of millennials work more than 40 hours a week.</span>

Are millennials really the laziest generation? They don’t seem to think so.

In fact, <span>66% of millennials identify as workaholics. </span>

To get a better understanding of millennials modern work habits, [FreshBooks](http://shrsl.com/19w35) compiled<span> the [Millennial Workaholics Index](https://www.freshbooks.com/press/data-research/freshbooks-millennial-workaholics-index), which polled a representative sample of 1,000 American freelancers.</span>

<span>Here’s what they discovered:</span>

**56% of Millennials Work More Than 40 Hours a Week**
-----------------------------------------------------

<span>They’re 8% more likely to work 40+ hours than those above 45! </span>

<span>1 in 5 millennials say they work over 60 hours in a typical week—and 70% say they’ve worked on the weekend.</span>

**32% of Millennials Have Worked in the Bathroom**
--------------------------------------------------

<span>That’s the percentage who say they’ve invoiced a customer while … multitasking. </span>

<span>Another 27% have invoiced a customer on a date, proving millennials are constantly on the grind even when they’re not in the office.</span>

**39% of Millennials Work Overtime Because They Love Their Jobs**
-----------------------------------------------------------------

<span>While 50% say they work more because they need the money, a solid 2 in 5 are passionate about their work.</span>

<span>This proves millennials don’t just work because they have to—they need to find meaning in their work.</span>

**The Weirdest Times Millennials Work**
---------------------------------------

As freelancers, we know that the working day can stretch – but the different between the working day and the weekend is increasingly becoming blurred millennial freelancers:

1. <span>On the weekend (70%)</span>
2. <span>When they’re sick (63%)</span>
3. <span>On their birthdays (63%)</span>
4. <span>Over the holiday break (51%)</span>
5. <span>On New Year’s Eve or Day (48%)</span>

There’s plenty more [freelance statistics](https://www.freshbooks.com/press/data-research/freshbooks-millennial-workaholics-index) in the infographic below.
