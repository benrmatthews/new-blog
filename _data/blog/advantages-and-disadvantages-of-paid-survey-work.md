Taking paid surveys, like most choices you can make to earn money, comes with both benefits and drawbacks. This post is intended to shine a light on these advantages and disadvantages and teach you more about earning money by completing paid surveys at home.

Taking Paid Online Surveys: The Benefits
----------------------------------------

### 1) No Stress Or Expenses From Commuting

The vast majority of full-time jobs oblige you to devote all too much time and money to traveling to and from your place of work. Commuting eats up hours of your day, and at the end of the month, the costs can add up to be dishearteningly expensive. You can both cut costs and bust stress by working from home!

### 2) The Comfort Of Working On Your Sofa

Is there a more [comfortable workspace ](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/279247)in the world than the one you’ve already created in your own home? Stretch out on your own sofa, cue up your favorite tunes or stream that show you’ve been meaning to binge on, and start earning money by filling out surveys. Paid online surveys allow you to make money from wherever you can get an internet connection. Why not hit the patio on sunny days?

### 3) Completely Flexible Scheduling

A major point in favor of completing paid surveys is that they can be filled out whenever you like, day or night. Feel the need to earn money at midnight? That’s no problem with survey work! You can set your own schedule and adjust your work around the events and errands that are important to you.

### 4) Let Your Voice Be Heard

[Paid online surveys](https://www.surveycool.com) give you a chance to speak directly to major consumer brands. Is your relationship with some of the products you use less than perfect? Paid surveys give you a chance to speak up and share your opinion in a context where it will carry a great deal of weight!

### 5) Motivate Yourself

Working from home puts you in total control of how you earn, no matter what sort of work you do. This is your chance to show off your full potential! There aren’t going to be any externally-imposed deadlines or tasks. Instead, you can set your own goals and earn your money in the way that suits you best.

### 6) More Family Time

It can be unbelievably challenging to hold down a full-time commuting job and also stay in touch with all your relatives and friends. Change up your priorities and put your social relationships first for a change! Paid surveys allow you to max out your family time, which is beneficial for your mood and productivity.

### 7) The Ultimate Pet-Friendly Office

Has saying goodbye to your pet every morning been a daily tragedy in your previous jobs? It’s a little sadness you can say goodbye to when you start working from home! The chance to work in close contact (hopefully not too close!) with your pets is another benefit that keeps online survey work stress-free and productive.

Taking Paid Online Surveys: Potential Drawbacks
-----------------------------------------------

### 1) Potential Isolation

When you get into a real grind doing paid surveys on your computer, things can get a little lonely. The upside to the hassle of commuting every day is that it gives you lots of opportunities to interact with other people and socialize. Home workers often end up missing these little human touches.

### 2) Being Your Own Boss Means Being Tough On Yourself

One of your responsibilities when you work from home is setting your own hours. Making sure that you put in enough work every day calls for strong self-discipline. Even if you’re highly organized, distractions and unexpected interruptions can pose a serious challenge to your schedule.

### 3) Flexible Earnings May Be Too Flexible

As a general rule of thumb, it’s wise to think of completing paid surveys as a handy method to earn extra pocket money. If you rely on it to meet all your financial needs, you may find yourself scrambling to cover all your bills in those months where survey work is hard to find.

### 4) The Work-From-Home Bloat

One downside to working at home is the tempting proximity of the refrigerator. Frequent snacking can boost your calorie intake over the line you want to keep it at. Don’t let those leftovers disappear faster than they should!

### 5) A World Of Distractions

Along with the necessity of setting your own schedule, you also have to set sharp limits on how much non-work amusement you allow yourself. Checking social media, surfing the web, and talking on the phone can end up siphoning off working hours without warning unless you keep a tight rein on distractions.

### 6) Scepticism

When you tell friends and acquaintances you’re working from home doing paid online surveys, you may get a few skeptical or downright disapproving looks. People who work from home often work as hard or even harder than office workers, but some outside observers will simply refuse to believe that.

### 7) Sub-Optimal Work Space

Your home is most likely arranged for comfort. That means you may find it lacking in a lot of useful productivity-boosting features that are obligatory in modern offices. Ergonomic desks and chairs, efficient ventilation, fas internet connections – a home workspace might lack some or all of these useful features.
