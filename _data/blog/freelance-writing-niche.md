<span class="s1">Have you been having a hard time selecting the perfect freelance writing niche? </span>

<span class="s1">Choosing the perfect freelance writing niche is similar to choosing the perfect outfit for a first date. You have tons of choices, but without confidence, you will not feel like you look your best.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span>

<span class="s1">If you are on the verge of giving up on selecting a niche, remember that to make it as a freelance writer, you ought to be in a highly profitable niche that will offer you consistent and lucrative work.</span>

<span class="s1">Having a niche helps to develop expertise, which increases your chances of landing high paying jobs. Once you develop niche expertise, you learn where the right facts, information, and statistics are and this makes your assignments a lot easier to handle.</span>

<span class="s1">Freelancers who have niche expertise have an easier time developing story ideas. With the right knowledge, it also becomes easier to interpret and write about emerging trends and ideas. </span>

<span class="s1">With time, experienced freelancers can increase their rates and get more high paying clients. </span>

<span class="s1">How can you choose the best niche and enjoy the perks of being regarded as an expert in your field? </span>

<span class="s1">**Build confidence**</span>
--------------------------------------------

<span class="s1">Without confidence, you cannot believe in your ability to give expert views and opinions in any niche. </span>

<span class="s1">How can you build confidence? </span>

<span class="s1">You can build confidence by writing on many topics to help [<span class="s3">improve your writing skills</span>](https://freetrain.co/business-writing-skills/). </span>

<span class="s1">If you are a newbie or you probably have not decided what to write about, try writing as many topics as you can. </span>

<span class="s1">In doing so, you will improve your writing skills but also identify the topics you enjoy writing about and those that you don’t. </span>

<span class="s1">**Look at supply and demand** </span>
------------------------------------------------------

<span class="s1">After identifying the topics, you like and those that you do not, look at the supply and demand. </span>

<span class="s1">There are many niches where supply is higher than demand. </span>

<span class="s1">This means that there are many freelancers with a limited number of businesses to hire them. </span>

<span class="s1">Unless you are very confident in your skills and ability to write unique content, do not venture into a saturated niche. </span>

<span class="s1">To find out if a niche is saturated, Google the name of the niche plus other keywords. </span>

<span class="s1">For instance, Google the niche travel plus the keyword blog, and you will see the number of travel blogs there are. </span>

<span class="s1">Alternatively, you can find out if there is a demand for content in your niche of choice by looking at the jobs posted on [<span class="s3">freelance job boards</span>](https://freetrain.co/freelance-jobs/). </span>

<span class="s1">By finding out if a niche is saturated, you’ll avoid spending your time on an industry that will not give you a high ROI.</span>

<span class="s1">**Look at your experience and passion**</span>
---------------------------------------------------------------

<span class="s1">Looking at your experience and passion are an excellent way to find a niche. </span>

<span class="s1">If you have experience working in a certain industry, chances are that you will be most comfortable writing about it. </span>

<span class="s1">The same case applies to topics that you are passionate about.</span>

<span class="s1">Experience and passion serve as guiding lights if you are not in writing for the money. </span>

<span class="s1">While most freelancers write to make money, freelance writing is not always about the money.</span>

<span class="s1"> Some people venture into writing because they are experienced in a specific industry, passionate about some topics, or they seek autonomy.</span>

**Freelance Writing Niche Examples**
------------------------------------

<span class="s1">Some of the niches you can venture into due to passion or experience include:</span>

- ### <span class="s1">**Academic editing and writing**</span>

<span class="s1">Most academic writers venture into this niche because they have vast experience in their fields of specialty. For instance, if you have been a Human Resource professor or manager for two years, you can write scholarly essays out of experience. </span>

<span class="s1">The academic writing industry is filled with quacks masquerading as professionals, and the input of a qualified professional is not only valued, but also in high demand. However, choosing a reliable essay company is not easy. You can overcome this challenge by seeking the services of reliable essay writing companies on [<span class="s3">ihatewritingessays.com</span>](https://www.ihatewritingessays.com/) review blog.</span>

- ### <span class="s1">**Case study writing**</span>

<span class="s1">Case studies are one of the most lucrative niches because they offer the social proof that companies need to drive sales. </span>

<span class="s1">Case studies are like testimonials, but instead of just writing a sentence or two about a customer’s experience, they tell a story about a customer’s transformation after using a product. If you are a highly skilled marketer, you can help organizations drive sales using case studies.</span>

- ### <span class="s1">**Video scripts writing**</span>

<span class="s1">Do you have lots of experience in script writing? You can make a decent buck, while pursuing your passion, by writing scripts for sales page videos, YouTube videos, home page videos, and many more. </span>

<span class="s1">For starters, begin by writing a script for an eye-catching video for your website, and this will attract clientele who want videos that convert.</span>

- ### <span class="s1">**Sex and relationships**</span>

<span class="s1">Being in a bad relationship is not only stressful, but it can also affect your performance in other areas of life. Thus, before people begin dating, they want to know if they are getting into a relationship with the right person, and they type of challenges to expect. </span>

<span class="s1">Also, people who are in bad relationships want tips to make them work or to break up without hurting the other person. Love makes the world go round; hence there is always a demand for advice on how to find love.</span>
