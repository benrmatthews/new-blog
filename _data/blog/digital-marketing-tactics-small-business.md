Small businesses don’t have a big marketing budget, but they have to compete against giants to keep operating. This is only possible if they work smart with their little budget. Digital marketing has, without a doubt, given them a chance, but even that can be difficult when your competitors have a bigger marketing budget than your total revenue.

This article will tell about the most important digital marketing tactics for small businesses, especially startups. This means you won’t have to invest money on practices that may or may not give you a return someday. The tactics shared in this article are sure to maximize your return on investment.

Google My Business
------------------

Google My Business is basically a large local business directory. When someone searches for the product or services, Google shows them a list of businesses from their area. This means you would want your business shown in that list when someone searches for the products or services you are selling.

You have to register your business with complete details such as your address and operating hours to Google My Business and make sure it’s fully optimized. Remember, there are also other businesses, including your competitors, that have registered with it. You should try to get your name at the top of the list as it gets the most responses.

Google Adwords
--------------

This is also an important digital marketing tactic for every small business and startup. People search their queries relevant to your business on Google. Every business tries to appear at the top in the result pages so the searcher will visit their website.

The problem is that organic ranking takes time and a lot of investment, which SMEs lack. This means you won’t get any traffic until you rank among the top five results if you are trying to attract [organic traffic](https://neilpatel.com/blog/5-steps-to-building-a-successful-organic-traffic-pipeline/).

You should keep trying to rank, but you shouldn’t depend on it. A simple answer is the use of Google Adwords. You can appear at the top of search engine result pages when someone searches a relevant query.

You will be charged for every click you get on your advertisement, but you will keep getting traffic. The best thing about it is that the searcher already understands his problem is looking for the best service provider. That visitor is most likely to become a lead or customer if you engage him properly on your website.

You just have to choose the right keywords.

Email Marketing
---------------

Email marketing is the cheapest digital marketing tactic and offers the best return on investment. Most consumers hate it and for a good reason.

If you want to make your email marketing successful, you have to work smart. Write smart emails and use a proper email marketing tool to track and measure the results. This way, you would know who opened your email, showed interest, who needs a push, and who should be left alone.

All these digital marketing tactics are sure to work and bring the maximum return on investment, but only if you know what you are doing. Otherwise, you will end up wasting a lot of your money on useless practices.

It’s suggested to use the services of a professional digital marketing company such as [Summon Digital](https://summon.co/). They will charge their service fee, but in the end, you get a better return on all your investments. Writing the wrong email, choosing the wrong keywords, and failing to engage the visitors won’t let you get ahead of your competitors.

Facebook Advertising
--------------------

Facebook is the biggest social media channel with the most active users. It’s also the best platform to increase brand awareness. Billions of people regularly use this platform for hours. You can select your target audience among them and show your ad to them.

It allows you to select the age, gender, geographic location, interests, education, and earning potential of your audience and filter them from the billions of Facebook users.

Building Organic Visitors
-------------------------

While you follow all advertising practices, you should also keep working on building your organic following. This includes both social media channels and search engines.

Try to rank for relevant keywords on Google and build a social media following on relevant channels relevant to your niche. This organic following and ranking will bring relevant visitors to your website without charging you a penny.
