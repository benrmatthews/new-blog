Monday 5 September 2011, saw the public launch of the [NSPCC](http://www.nspcc.org.uk/) Sexual Abuse theme campaign [‘Rebuilding Childhoods’ in the Metro newspaper](http://www.metro.co.uk/news/874441-child-sex-victims-are-left-to-suffer-according-to-nspcc). The Metro kicked off the campaign with a front page feature on how young victims of child sex abuse can be driven to suicide without expert help.

> Child abuse can devastate lives. Its effects can be profound, and for some children can last a lifetime. It can rob children of their self-esteem and their childhood innocence.

The ‘Rebuilding Childhoods’ campaign is pushing for a massive growth in the number of therepeutic centres for sexaully abused children and young people over the coming years.  
The campaign will hopefully convince the government to ensure there is at least one treatment centre in every local authority area.
