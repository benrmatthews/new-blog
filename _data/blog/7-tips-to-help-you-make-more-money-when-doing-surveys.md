Surveys can be a legit way to make some extra cash and we all know that can come in very handy at the end of the month.

However, not all surveys are created equally and understanding how to sort the good from the not so good is a must. So, what do you need to look for? Here are 6 important tips that could make all the difference.

**Understand the real purpose behind the paid survey**
------------------------------------------------------

Companies put out paid surveys in order to improve or release products or services and find out the reaction of individual customers to those products or services. The use of surveys helps for the development of new offerings to their existing customer base. As you are trying to make money with online paid surveys, it is important to keep these things in mind.

**Do your Research**
--------------------

If there is one tip that I would like to provide for you more than any other, it is to choose the websites where you will be taking surveys very carefully. The available options can be overwhelming and you may want to try your hand and a number of different options. At that point, you can choose the type of [best paid online surveys](http://www.matthewwoodward.co.uk/tutorials/best-survey-sites/) with the style and the interface that is best for your needs.

When taking surveys, you should try to maximize the use of your time so that you can make as much money as possible. That means that the website you choose for making money with surveys may not be the same as what somebody else would choose.

Prior to the time that you make your decision, take a close look at the reviews and see the options available for payout. Those options could include a transfer to your bank account, points or gift cards. You also want to know how many different surveys are available and if they have a mobile app to make things more convenient. Is it possible to use their service 24 hours a day? Is there a lot of positive feedback about the service they provide?

**Consider It a Hobby or a Side Income**
----------------------------------------

Far too many people are fooled into believing that they will make a full-time living or even get rich by taking online surveys. Unless you are living on a park bench somewhere, you are not going to be able to make this a career and [stay afloat financially](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/family/make-money-online).

If your objective is to have a little bit of extra money in your pocket, however, then taking paid surveys online may be just the way to achieve it. Don’t consider it a reliable source of income, just appreciate the fact that you have some extra cash coming your way every month.

**Legit Surveys**
-----------------

Unfortunately, there are going to be websites that offer surveys and they are not fully legitimate. Some may even ask you to pay a fee upfront so that you can take the surveys in the first place. Don’t fall for this trap. If you know where to look, you will find plenty of legitimate websites so that you can take surveys, signing up for free and get a frequent payout for your efforts. The most convenient payout methods tend to be PayPal, gift cards or a transfer to your bank account.

**Establish a Secondary Email Account That Is Only Used for Survey Websites**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unless you enjoy thousands of spam emails coming into your inbox on a daily basis, make sure that you set up a second email account. Believe me, you are going to thank be when you see just how many emails are flooding into that secondary account daily. It only takes a few minutes to establish a new email account and you can use a free service, such as Gmail or Yahoo. Get this started as priority one.

**Using Math When Taking Surveys**
----------------------------------

You may find that many [survey sites](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/money-saving-tips/11042019/Five-minute-guide-to-making-easy-money-with-online-surveys.html) are somewhat cryptic in telling you about the payout for certain surveys. As an example, it may take approximately 20 minutes to take a survey and you will earn 2 dollars for doing so. You can use those numbers to determine if it is worth your time to take it in the first place. When you do the math, you will find that you will be earning 6 dollars per hour for that survey, but that’s not bad when you consider you can do it while watching Netflix.

**Keep a Realistic Outlook – You Are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> Going to Get Rich**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Taking market research studies is not going to make you rich. Because of the low entry barrier for this type of work, you will never be able to use it as a major source of income.

Try to look at things realistically when it comes to online surveys. Rather than trying to make it a full-time venture, use it as something that complements your income from your day-to-day job. That is true, even though there are many people who claim to make it a full-time venture.
