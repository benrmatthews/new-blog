**Freelance statistics are a great way to show you how you’re not alone in wanting to go freelance, how others are finding the freelance environment and how freelancers contribute to the overall economy.**

Following this post and discussion on [definition of freelancing](https://freetrain.co/definition-freelancing-changed-meet-new-5-types-freelancers/ "The definition of freelancer is changing: meet the 5 new types of freelancers"), we’ve pulled together more freelance stats from the US, UK, Europe, Japan and further afield for you to get an idea of how freelancers are faring across the world.

Arm yourself with these stats if anyone asks you “Why would you want to go freelance?” and show them that you’re not alone!

**US Freelance Statistics**
---------------------------

“Freelancing in America” is the most comprehensive measure of the independent workforce. How many Americans are freelancing? Why? How will they play a critical role in the rapid evolution of work?

The study, conducted by an independent research firm and commissioned in partnership by Upwork and Freelancers Union, surveyed more than 6,000 U.S. workers.

In its fifth annual year, findings show Americans are spending more than 1 billion hours per week freelancing.

Beyond quantifying the amount of freelancing happening, new insights delve into why people are increasingly choosing to work this way.

The five most notable findings reveal:

- ***Americans are spending more time freelancing:** Average weekly hours spent freelancing increased 72 million hours per week from 998 million in 2015 to more than one billion hours per week of freelancing this year.*
- **Technology is making it easier to find work:** 64% of freelancers found work online, a 22 point increase since 2014.
- **Lifestyle matters most:** Both freelancers and non-freelancers prioritize achieving the lifestyle that they want but freelancers are more likely to get it.​ 51% of all freelancers say no amount of money would get them to take a traditional job.
- **Freelancers are more politically active:** In this election season, freelancers indicated they are 19 points more politically active than non-freelancers. More than seven in 10 (72%) said they’d be willing to cross party lines to vote for candidates who support freelancer interests.
- **Freelancers place more value on skills training: ​**93% of freelancers with a four-year college degree said training was useful versus only 79% who said their college education was useful to the work they do now; and 70% of full-time freelancers participated in skills training in the past six months compared to only 49% of full-time non-freelancers.

![Freelance Statistics - The Freelance Economy in Numbers](https://freetrain.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Freelance-Statistics-The-Freelance-Economy-in-Numbers.png)


The [Freelancers Union “53 million” report](http://freelancersunion.org/53million) contains data results of the most comprehensive survey of the U.S. independent workforce in nearly a decade. Here are a few of the main stats from the report:

- The opportunity to work on a variety of different projects and across sectors is also appealing, with over a third (38%) saying this is a significant pull
- Respondents are also attracted to the earning potential of freelance work with 38% saying they feel they can earn as much, if not more than they could in a traditional job

We’ll keep adding to these as I come across more research, but if you find any freelance statistics that would be worth adding here then leave a comment and a link below.
