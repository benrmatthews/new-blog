Freelance statistics are a great way to show you how you’re not alone in wanting to go freelance, how others are finding the freelance environment and how freelancers contribute to the overall economy.

Following yesterday’s post and discussion on [the 5 new types of freelancers](http://benrmatthews.com/2014/09/definition-freelancing-changed-meet-new-5-types-freelancers/ "The definition of freelancer is changing: meet the 5 new types of freelancers"), I’ve pulled together more freelance stats from the US, UK and further afield for you to get an idea of how freelancers are faring across the world. Arm yourself with these stats if anyone asks you “Why would you want to go freelance?” and show them that you’re not alone!

US Freelance Statistics
-----------------------

The [Freelancers Union “53 million” report](http://freelancersunion.org/53million) contains data results of the most comprehensive survey of the U.S. independent workforce in nearly a decade. Here are a few of the main stats from the report:

- There are 53 million people doing freelance work in the US – 34% of the national workforce
- People who freelance contribute an estimated $715 billion in freelance earnings to our economy
- Twice as many freelancers have seen an increase in demand in the past year as have seen a decrease – 32% experienced an increase versus 15% who have seen a decrease
- 80% of non-freelancers say they would be willing to do work outside their primary job to make more money
- Earning extra money (but not financial necessity) and schedule flexibility are the top drivers of freelancing
- Finding work and, correspondingly, income stability are the top barriers to doing more freelancing work
- 69% of freelancers said technology has made it easier to find freelance work
- 77% of freelancers say the best days are yet ahead for freelancing
- 65% said freelancing as a career path is more respected today than it was three years ago
- 36% of moonlighters who have a primary job have thought about quitting to work completely independently

UK Freelance Statistics
-----------------------

In the UK, the Professional Contractors Group estimates that:

- There are 1.4 million British freelancers working across all sectors
- This has grown 14% in the past decade
- The flexibility offered by Britain’s freelancers is worth £21 billion to the UK economy in added value
- 78% of the UK public think that freelancing and flexible working help promote a good work/life balance
- 72% think freelancing has a positive effect on family life

According to [a report by freelance job site](https://www.elance.com/q/sites/default/files/docs/gen-y-and-the-gigging-economy.pdf), Elance:

- In 2013, the number of businesses hiring freelancers online increased 46%
- Payments to freelancers increased 37% year on year
- The average hourly rate for UK freelancers increased 6.7% in 2013
- IT &amp; Programming (at 41% of all hires); Design &amp; Multimedia (24%) and Writing &amp; Translation (18%) make up the majority of freelance jobs online

A February 2014 report on [Gen Y and Freelancing](https://www.elance.com/q/sites/default/files/docs/gen-y-and-the-gigging-economy.pdf) looked at “the transformation of UK graduate career aspirations and what this means for businesses”. Here are the key stats from the report:

- Freelancing is now seen as a highly attractive and lucrative career option by 87% of students with first or second class degrees
- his compares to 77% of those with lower class degrees.
- 21% of graduates with first class honours say they have already chosen to work as a freelancer, suggesting that the freelance economy’ is beginning to take hold among those graduates with the strongest degree results
- 29% of all graduates say freelancing is part of their career strategy for the next five years, a fact that suggests the freelance economy will continue to gather pace in the UK
- The flexibility offered by freelancing is cited as the biggest career draw, with over two thirds (69%) of all graduates saying they feel independent work offers them a better work-life balance.
- The opportunity to work on a variety of different projects and across sectors is also appealing, with over a third (38%) saying this is a significant pull
- Respondents are also attracted to the earning potential of freelance work with 38% saying they feel they can earn as much, if not more than they could in a traditional job
- Elance data shows that the average hourly rate for UK freelancers increased 6.7% in 2013

The [Labour Force Survey](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-force-survey-employment-status-by-occupation/april---june-2010/index.html), conducted by the Office of National Statistics, showed a breakdown of the self-employed by sector:

- Senior Managers – 15% self-employed
- IT Professionals – 13% self-employed
- Engineering Professionals – 12 %
- ‘Associate Professionals’ in Design and Media – 40%
- ‘Skilled tradespeople’ in construction – 56%

European Freelance Statistics
-----------------------------

According to a report called “Future Working: The Rise of Europe’s Independent Professionals”, the European freelance economy looks like the following:

- Freelance numbers have increased by 45% from just under 6.2 million to 8.9 million in 2013, making them the fastest growing group in the EU labour market

According to the Professional Contractors Group:

- Spain and Slovakia have both have 13% rates of self-employment
- Italy has a 21% rates of self-employment

I’ll keep adding to these as I come across more research, but if you find any freelance statistics that would be worth adding here then leave a comment and a link below.
