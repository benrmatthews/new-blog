[Instagram](http://web.archive.org/web/20120211232550/http://instagram.com/), the mobile photo sharing community, are doing a great job of showcasing how different charities are using the platform to engage with a new community of users, all through sharing photos.

They list 3 examples in their post on [Nonprofit organizations using Instagram](http://web.archive.org/web/20120211232550/http://blog.instagram.com/post/8758032746/nonprofits-on-instagram): Robin Hood NYC, Oceana and Charity: Water.

Here’s the tactics being used by those 3 charities to tell their stories:

- <span class="Apple-style-span">Use Instagram to live stream fan photos from a fundraising event</span>
- <span class="Apple-style-span">Develop a custom photo visualization using </span>[Instagram’s API](http://web.archive.org/web/20120211232550/http://www.instagram.com/developer)<span class="Apple-style-span">.</span>
- <span class="Apple-style-span">Encouraging Instagrammers to share their photos of engaging with your cause ocean.</span>
- <span class="Apple-style-span">Hashtag photos appropriately to get them included among the other relevant photos already on Instagram</span>
- <span class="Apple-style-span">shares photos from the field to show the impact of your work</span>
- <span class="Apple-style-span">Take snapshots from around the office to show what the team is working on</span>
