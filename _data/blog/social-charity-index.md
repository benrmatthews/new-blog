Two years on from producing the first Social Charity Study, the team at Visceral Business have produced the Social Charity Index 2013, a report looking into how phenomenal and substantial the growth of social and digital media has become among charities in the UK.

A few headlines from the report:

- The average rate of growth in terms of user take-up across the four main platforms of Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube averages at around 350% over that time.
- Networking technology means that large and small charities are now operating on a more level playing field.
- Smaller charities tend to have higher levels of authenticity among their social followings. They also have a closer inter-relationship between the amount of supporters and revenue raised.
- Small charities often have supporters who are better at sharing: their networks may be smaller but are relatively strong
- Levels of income raised have dropped by 26% over the last two years, but social sharing has bucked that trend and increased by 152%
- As income levels are challenged, turning likes, retweets and shares into income and working in more agile and responsive ways is taking centre stage
- The power of the smartphone, mobile connections and networked relationships with third parties including giving platforms is on the increase

The Social Charity Index 2013 also looks at the top 100 social charities in the UK. Their survey findings – provided in collaboration with over 60 UK charities – looked at the digital and social activity of 300 charities nationally, across Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+ and YouTube.

The top 10 charities according to the report are:

1. Save The Children
2. Comic Relief
3. Oxfam
4. Dogs Trust
5. The British Museum
6. Tate
7. Macmillan Cancer Support
8. Cancer Research
9. British Red Cross
10. The National Gallery

A charity’s website is a crucial first impression and the look and feel of your relationship with supporters starts there. Charities that tell a powerful story and have a strong visual character stand out more and stay in the mind.

### <span id="2_Social_Network_Signposts">2. Social Network Signposts</span>

Signpost people to where your charity can be found across social networks so they can connect with you easily. Thinking about the entire supporter journey from the user’s perspective will make it easier to develop an integrated content plan that connects people.

### <span id="3_Content_Curation">3. Content Curation</span>

Good curation is a powerful way to develop a strong digital culture. Video and rich media can create really powerful scrapbooks that people can go back to, enjoy and share.

### <span id="4_Audience_Analysis">4. Audience Analysis</span>

Social network analysis can be a great way of getting to know your supporters and to build your charity’s networked culture, so that events can become shared experiences.

### <span id="5_Consider_Commercial">5. Consider Commercial</span>

Consider how your cause can become embedded into everyday life through partnerships with commercial organisations. Social business principles can be used to develop innovative new ways to fundraise.

### <span id="6_Connectors_and_Communicators">6. Connectors and Communicators</span>

Who are the people in your charity who are the natural connectors and communicators? Supporting them with training can help them feel comfortable and empowered using digital media.
