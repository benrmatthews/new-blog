[How to Get a Job in PR](http://www.amazon.co.uk/How-get-job-Sarah-Stimson-ebook/dp/B00GX9DXVA/ "How to Get a Job in PR") is [Sarah Stimson’s](http://www.stimsonsarah.com/ "Sarah Stimson") fantastic book on how to break into the PR industry.

The book is a comprehensive guide to finding and keeping the PR job you dream of, answering all sorts of questions you may have about the PR industry and helping with many more that might not have even crossed your mind.

The book covers everything you need to know to get a job in PR and beyond, including:

– A thorough overview of different PR sectors and disciplines  
– An excellent step-by-step guide to creating an effective PR CV  
– Helpful job application tips  
– Indispensable advice on how best to represent yourself in an interview  
– Top advice from leading industry figures  
– A recommended reading list and directory of useful contacts

Sarah herself has over 10 years of PR and recruitment experience, placing people in jobs both in PR agencies and in-house communications teams from entry level all the way up to the most senior roles, so is one of the best in the industry at helping you land that dream PR job.

What I like even more is that 10% of royalties generated by the book will be donated to the [Taylor Bennett Foundation](http://www.taylorbennettfoundation.org/ "TBF"), which addresses the need for greater diversity in the communications &amp; PR industry. So not only will you be getting a great book, but you’ll be helping others get a break into the industry too.

Each chapter with quotes from senior practitioners giving their advice on how to break into the industry, which offer invaluable insights beyond the advice that Sarah gives. Here’s a selection of the choiciest quotes:

-------------------------------------------------------

> It’s common to hear people vigorously outline the benefits of either in-house or agency roles as THE answer to junior career development. Having experienced both sides of the fence, I would recommend both.
> 
> The balance of the experience may vary, with agency giving breadth, and in-house depth, but both experiences will ultimately rest on the attitude of the person going into the role.
> 
> How committed are you to seeking out the views of a wide range of direct and indirect colleagues? How much effort are you going to put into developing your skills beyond that your employer provides? How much, at the end of the day, do you want it?

--------------------------------------------------------------

> I’ve been teaching public relations in universities for ten years, yet even I’ll admit that a degree is not enough (and a PR degree is still not essential).
> 
> A degree indicates something. It should indicate curiosity and an ability to learn, and this is easily assessed at interview by asking about current affairs (or sport or popular culture).
> 
> Good candidates should also have gained some work experience. They will also have the right attitude and have something to show for their time outside the classroom. Have they written for online magazines? Do they have their own blog? What about their presence on social networks?

> The smart students that quickly find jobs are the ones that start thinking about their future employment long before they leave college or graduate. The Internet has given rise to a huge variety of publishing tools and sharing platforms that anyone can use to develop an online network and profile.
> 
> I’d urge you to find a media format and platform that you’re comfort with and start creating and sharing content about your future profession. That might be a WordPress blog, images on Flickr, or video on YouTube. S
> 
> econd start building a network. LinkedIn and Twitter are a good place to start.Social networks are democratic and enable anyone to follow conversations taking place online. That’s a short step to creating content and engaging with people throughout the industry. Start with me. I’m @wadds on Twitter.

> We get people walking through the door at Ketchum all the time that claim to be socially and digitally savvy yet they’ve never blogged and they aren’t on Twitter. Do yourself a favour and get a ahead of the game. It’ll pay dividends personally as these skills are much in demand and it will help you understand the challenges that brands face in engaging with audiences in the modem media environment.

I was humbled to be asked by Sarah to give a quote or two as well, which are as follows:

<span id="Tips_on_how_to_stay_motivated_when_working_from_home">Tips on how to stay motivated when working from home</span>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Maintaining focus while working from home can be a hard task. Getting up to make yet another cup of tea disrupts this focus and stops you getting the important work done. To help keep that focus, make a to do list of the 3 most important tasks you need to finish that day – and make sure you finish them. Then even if you do nothing else, you’ll have completed the most important work.
> 
> Other tips include turing off email and social networks for an hour, so you can concentrate on actually getting work done. Also, leave the TV switched off as it’s too attention grabbing, but radio can be nice as background noise.
> 
> Make sure you finish work at an appointed time in the evening, no matter what. Not only will you be more focussed in order to get finished on time, but you’ll also be able to relax in the evening and get a better night’s sleep. You can always get up early the next day to finish off anything urgent, but your mind will be more refreshed and you’ll finish the task quicker than if you plow on into the night.

<span id="What_are_PR_degrees">What are PR degrees?</span>
----------------------------------------------------------

> PR Degrees equip you with both the theory and practical skills required to get a job and then build a successful career in the PR industry.
> 
> The best PR degrees have a strong practical element and good links with the PR industry, so you can start building your industry contacts while still studying. Your tutors should be experts with significant industry experience, supported by visiting lecturers who can give you an insight into the day-to-day workings of the industry.
> 
> Digital and social media is more important than ever, so if you choose a PR degree then make sure this part of the programme is strong.
