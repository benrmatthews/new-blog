<span style="font-weight: 400;">One key area of online freelancing that has emerged throughout the last few years is videography. Videographers were previously limited to video houses and studios which charge the earth for production costs. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, individual specialists can be hired for on-going work or one-off projects that can range from creating 1 minute video clips to editing feature-length movies and documentaries.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The growth of freelancing platforms such as </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Upwork</span>](https://www.upwork.com/)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> continue to increase and are helping to bridge the gap between freelancers and projects.</span>

*<span style="font-weight: 400;">Source: Upwork –</span>*[*<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Google Trends</span>*](https://trends.google.com/trends/)*<span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2004 – Present</span>*

**The Two Types of Videography Freelancer**
-------------------------------------------

#### **1. The ‘One-man-band’**

![One Man Band Videography Freelancer](https://freetrain.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/One-Man-Band-Videography-Freelancer.png)

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a ‘one-man-band’, you’ll own cameras, microphones and other shooting equipment that allow you to take on physical shooting gigs in your area or region. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of these will be events like weddings, events, music videos, short films, promo videos and corporate videos. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a ton of work in this **IF** you’re close to the kind of regional hubs where this style of work takes place.</span>

**Pros:**

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical shoots are often quite lucrative (several hundreds pounds or dollars for a day’s work)</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Face-to-face networking can lead to ongoing or permanent roles</span>

**Cons:**

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Start-up costs are obviously high and are even higher if you want to bid for top level gigs</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Competitive freelance environment in major cities </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If it isn’t possible to position yourself favourably for these on-site gigs, or if you plan on taking the digital nomad path to online freelancing, then do not fear – video freelancing is still easily achievable.</span>

#### **2. The Digital Videographer**

![Digital Videographer](https://freetrain.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Digital-Videographer.png)

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you wish to stay mobile or don’t live in proximity to a region with regular filming opportunities then you can work exclusively from your PC. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whilst your PC and video editing skills will need to be good enough to finish projects, you won’t need to purchase filming equipment. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your daily tasks could involve editing, animation, mastering, colour grading, CGI or almost any other task that can be performed ‘in-the-box’ (e.g. within editing software). </span>

**Pros:**

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Can work remotely from anywhere</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower start-up costs</span>

**Cons:**

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Little opportunity for face-to-face networking</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Limited to work that involves video editing software</span>

**What Qualities Should a Good Videographer Have?**
---------------------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a person, a good videographer should be creative and pragmatic in solving problems. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the freelance world, prospective clients will often contact you with a basic set of needs and </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">expect you to work out exactly what they need.</span>](https://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/freelance-video-managing-client-expectations/)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To work out a client’s needs, you’ll need to be able to make a critical assessment of their technical expectations and respond accordingly. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication is key as you’ll be messaging prospective clients all the time. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being able to communicate in a concise, friendly and professional manner will win you more jobs more often. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is massive – no matter what your [freelance portfolio](https://freetrain.co/freelance-portfolio/) says about you, a poorly written cover letter will reduce your chances of getting freelance work.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from that, you should be flexible and intuitive in responding to client needs. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The freelance world is largely message based but it’s still important to remain humanistic in your conversations.</span>

#### **Research, Learn and Educate Yourself about the Film and Video Production Industry** <span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowledge is power, so make sure to refresh up on your movie making knowledge and know the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">video production process in and out</span>](https://www.stagephod.com/2018/04/video-production-process-2/)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> because it’ll help you to build your skills and [find freelancer clients fast](https://go.freetrain.co/find-freelance-clients-fast).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The video production industry is huge and this is largely thanks to the entertainment industry. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Films, documentaries and TV programs occupy the vast majority of the video industry in terms of revenue and employment. </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Box-office revenue is forecast to exceed $50 billion in 2020</span>](https://www.statista.com/topics/964/film/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The online freelance videography landscape is formed mostly by smaller projects and occasional ongoing work but it’s still a massive industry. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he number of freelance workers in videography has grown vastly and in the UK, </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">just under half of all workers in the video industry are freelance. </span>](https://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/downloads/bfi-employment-in-the-film-industry-2017-08-30.pdf)

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing what to expect is really important when you start out freelancing. Here are some examples of what to expect from a freelance video career:</span>

#### **Physical Work**

- **TV and film.**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Even large organisations like </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Film4</span>](http://www.channel4.com/channel/film4)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">BBC </span>](https://www.bbc.co.uk/partnersandsuppliers/freelancers/freelance-work-at-the-bbc)<span style="font-weight: 400;">will look to hire freelancers but most frequently, you’ll see smaller private projects advertised like producing interviews or corporate video. </span>
- **Example:**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> You might be expected to film someone in an interview format (e.g. a talk on a new product release) and then professionally edit it to perfection.</span>
- **Events.**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gigs filming events of any kind are commonplace and could be anything from filming corporate training days to weddings, parties and music events. </span>
- **Example**<span style="font-weight: 400;">. You might be expected to film a village fete for a day and then edit down the footage into a fun showreel that will be promoted online.</span>

#### **Digital**

- **Video editing.**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is a major area of freelance videography, the work can be incredibly varied so being flexible is key. I.e. many individuals and organisations might film some footage themselves and then realise they have no way of professionally editing it. Alternatively, they might have received tons of raw footage and need to decide which clips to use for the final version. Video editing can be anything from taking hundreds of clips and turning them into coherent footage to colour grading and lighting or CGI. </span>
- **Example.**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> A business filmed a DIY video of their factory production process and want to edit it into an awesome video with some enhancements to colour and lighting.</span>
- **Animation.**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Animation is obviously an entire industry in its own right but jobs requesting short 1-minute marketing videos are extremely common. You don’t even need animation skills to create them, you can use online programs such as </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Moovly</span>](https://www.moovly.com/blog/make-your-own-cartoon-video-for-free)<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Combined with a bit of video editing knowledge, you can enhance animations created with these programs and touch them up to a higher professional standard. </span>
- **Example:**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> An IT security consultancy want a 1-minute animation detailing the key areas of online security and how they can assist with prospective clients. </span>

**Ongoing Training**
--------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re entering the world of freelance videography you may quickly realise that you need to become well versed in a diverse range of areas in the industry. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Take the time to train yourself in areas which you’re interested in working in. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are tons of courses on everything from basic and advanced animation to extensive video editing. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some websites which offer online videography courses:</span>

- [<span style="font-weight: 400;">Video School Online</span>](https://www.videoschoolonline.com/video-editing-101-course/)
- [<span style="font-weight: 400;">Larry Jordan</span>](https://larryjordan.com/)
- [<span style="font-weight: 400;">Udemy</span>](https://www.udemy.com/static/upgrade-your-browser/)
- [<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lynda</span>](http://www.lynda.com/Video-Editing-training-tutorials/82-0.html)


**Select and Learn a Video Editing Program**
--------------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being able to understand and use video editing software is one of the most challenging areas of modern videography. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to be able to understand the client’s request and contextualise the actions you’ll need to take within your favourite editing program.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As an aspiring videographer, it’s likely that you’ll possess some video editing software knowledge already but if you plan on stepping forward into the freelance world then you’ll need to select your weapon of choice and brush up on your skills. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We advise that you pick </span>**one**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> main editing program.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> There really are tons of options but the industry standard is probably </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Adobe Premiere Pro</span>](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)<span style="font-weight: 400;">. It couples with After Effects and other member programs of </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Adobe’s Creative Cloud</span>](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html)<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For many aspiring freelancers, Adobe Premiere is prohibitively priced at $19.99 monthly but fortunately, there are </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">plenty of viable alternatives to choose from</span>](https://blog.filestage.io/adobe-premiere-alternative/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>


### **YouTube as Video Resource**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking for resources for learning video editing then look no further than YouTube. Here are some great tutorial channels:</span>

- [<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cinecom</span>](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpLfM1_MIcIQ3jweRT19LVw)
- [<span style="font-weight: 400;">Justin Odisho</span>](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy7DyWXJ0jghyMsUoOU6F7g)
- [<span style="font-weight: 400;">Aputure</span>](https://www.youtube.com/user/aputurephoto)
- [<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Film Look</span>](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG8T8xZYuuiSxa5mOHz2Q2g)
- [<span style="font-weight: 400;">Peter McKinnon</span>](https://www.youtube.com/user/petermckinnon24)

**Purchase the Right Equipment**
--------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned earlier, determining your path in freelance videography will be a significant factor in determining what equipment you’ll need. </span>

#### **One-man-band**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you plan on forming a ‘one-man-band’ which can take on physical shooting jobs like weddings, events and corporate videos then you’re going to need a considerable amount of video equipment. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your budget equipment range could cost between £2000 and £50,000 or above and it should be viewed as strategic investment. </span>

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">A professional camera. The </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Panasonic HPX170</span>](https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-AG-HPX170-High-Definition-Camcorder-Optical/dp/B001E96LGI)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> is awesome (pictured below)</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">A professional microphone kit </span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Headphones</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Battery chargers of all kinds, spare batteries, cables, accessories, tape</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Optional lighting gear</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Optional lenses </span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Optional green screen equipment</span>

![Freelance Video Production](https://freetrain.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Freelance-Video-Production.png)

#### **Digital Videographer**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The ‘one-man-band’ path isn’t for everybody. If you’re not going down that route then you should concentrate on the following:</span>

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">A professional level laptop, preferably with a big screen (4K is becoming increasingly important)</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Solid backup hard drives like the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">OWC Elite Pro (minis)</span>](http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/firewire/EliteALmini/eSATA_FW800_FW400_USB)
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional monitor headphones such as the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sennheiser HD 380 </span>](https://en-uk.sennheiser.com/monitoring-headphone-studio-headphone-professional-audio-hd-380-pro)
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">A USB microphone like the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Blue Yeti</span>](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Silver/dp/B002VA464S)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great microphone for portability</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">**Your Freelance Portfolio** </span>
--------------------------------------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A videography [freelance portfolio](https://freetrain.co/freelance-portfolio/) revolves around something called a showreel. This is a reel of clips that showcases your best work. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most showreels are short and can be even as short as one minute in length. However, we recommend aiming for 3 minutes of well-labelled and organised footage. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few ways you can display your [freelance portfolio](https://freetrain.co/freelance-portfolio/). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can showcase it publically on </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Behance</span>](https://www.behance.net/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, a social network designed for creatives or place files in a Google Drive folder and link that to prospective clients along with a text transcript of your work. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, you can upload your portfolio to </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube</span>](https://www.youtube.com/)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and/or </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Vimeo</span>](https://vimeo.com/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Vimeo Pro</span>](https://vimeo.com/professionals)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> that allows you to upload password protected videos which is useful if you just want to show your clients edits or cuts.</span>

![Vimeo Freelance Videographer Portolios](https://freetrain.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Vimeo-Freelance-Videographer-Portolios.png)

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To strengthen your portfolio, be active on Social Media and leverage tools such as </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">BuzzSumo</span>](http://buzzsumo.com/)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to scout out and connect with Social Media Influencers. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re YouTubing your portfolio then work hard to promote your content so you can gain some likes, views and comments. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A great way of building your portfolio’s credibility is by posting relevant links around forums such as </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reddit</span>](https://www.reddit.com)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, Facebook Groups, LinkedIn Groups and Slack Communities.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whilst it’s great having a fixed portfolio, you need to realise that your work will develop and you’ll need to gradually add to your reel. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why freelancing platforms such as </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Behance</span>](https://www.behance.net/)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> are great as you can update your portfolio at any time. </span>

### ![Behance Freelance Videographer Portolios](https://freetrain.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Behance-Freelance-Videographer-Portolios.png)

### **Tailor Your Freelance Portfolio**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be aware that it’s best to tailor your [freelance portfolio](https://freetrain.co/freelance-portfolio/) to each client you’re applying to. For example, if you’re applying to an art / creative project then you might want to miss out more corporate videos and vice versa. </span>

### **Animate and Label Your Footage**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Always label and annotate footage. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can either add text and captions, slides between projects to explain what they are or if you’re using YouTube, you can annotate with the Annotation Editor (now called </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cards</span>](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6140493?co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop&hl=en)<span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This will help you to keep organised, reduce your time spent building different showreels or portfolios whilst giving you more time to apply for potential freelancing projects.</span>


**Establish an Online Presence**
--------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Building your reputation is the biggest factor that will help you gain access to the most exciting and lucrative freelance opportunities. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first profiles you should focus on are your main client generation profiles. These will most likely be </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Upwork</span>](https://www.upwork.com/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">PeoplePerHour</span>](https://www.peopleperhour.com/)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other freelance websites (full list in the next section). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You really want to ace your profile on these platforms and make them look as good as you possibly can. Fill out all profile info, qualifications, etc.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some other social media accounts we recommend:</span>

1. [<span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube</span>](https://www.youtube.com/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">: This is an obvious one. You should routinely upload projects to YouTube. Obviously, any personal project is fine to upload but you need to check with clients if you want to upload clips to a reel of recent work. </span>

It makes for a great digital portfolio gallery and even features its own built-in jobs page. You can sync it up to Creative Cloud if you wish to, enabling you to easily cut bits out of your project from Adobe programs for easy upload. Behance allows for the upload of almost any media and will retain high quality which is important for any visual portfolio.</span>
3. [<span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram:</span>](https://www.instagram.com/?hl=en)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Instagram is obviously buzzing with users and with hashtags, you can easily fire off your work into useful and relevant social circles. Instagram can create leads for you all by itself if you simply track your activities and Instagram them regularly. The big downside to using Instagram is that it can destroy file quality and videos are the worst affected. </span>

**Client / Customer Acquisition**
---------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your main arena for client acquisition are freelance websites. These are sites where employers in the form of individuals, organisations and businesses can post requests for work. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a freelancer, you can browse their listings and apply with a cover letter/proposal. Some job posts will have budgets but many are just a guide – it’s up to you to judge the job in terms of hours and pay. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a look at FreeTrain’s [Freelance Jobs Board](https://freetrain.co/freelance-jobs-uk/) as well.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you sign up, complete all forms properly and make sure to include a friendly portrait photo as a profile picture. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some websites, like PeoplePerHour, have an endorsement feature where previous clients can vouch for your work similar to LinkedIn.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you apply for work:</span>

- **Your cover letter is everything.**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> We recommend being upbeat and enthusiastic in tone. Always read the job post and reference it in your cover to letter to show that you’ve actually read and understood it. Relate your experience to the job and explain how your skills are able to fulfil their project’s requirements.</span>
- **Try to be helpful.**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> That means offering your own insight as a creative professional. Build rapport by asking about the project and complimenting it if appropriate.</span>
- **Always ask questions to help you refine your brief.** <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you accept a job and then ask tons of extra questions then it doesn’t only make you look like you didn’t consider the role, it also gives your client an opportunity to load you with more work and extra tasks.</span>
- **Consider these** [**psychological tips for composing messages.** ](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/threat-management/201311/dont-type-me-email-and-emotions)<span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always try to gauge the tone of the job poster and respond by matching their tone and sentence length. Matching their messaging showcases your flexibility with language and showcases to potential clients that you’re competent at writing video scripts.</span>
- **An Example of an Outreach Message:**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hi \[Name\] I was just looking through your project notes/job listing, I’ve worked in XYZ before, etc. Please see my attached showreel which contains the following clips, I’ve previously worked on \[Project Skill\], \[Project Skill 2\] that are specifically relevant to your \[Project Name\]. I look forward to hearing from you.</span>

**Time Tracking**
-----------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you take on freelance work, the most likely scenario is that you’ll be offering a [freelance rate](https://freetrain.co/freelance-rates/) per milestone or project. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if the task is to edit 2 hours of film footage then it’s up to you to consider how long this will take you and offer an overall amount that covers your time and work. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A second scenario is that you’ll work at an hourly rate. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To do this properly, you’ll have to give the client an indication of how long the project will take and then charge per hour. You’d then begin work, track your time and charge accordingly. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Time tracking is optional but there’s no doubt that it’s a rising force in the freelance world. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Time tracking helps both you and your client to view and understand the activities that have contributed towards a project’s completion. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes a client will be pretty stringent on seeing timed evidence of your work but most of the time, they’ll be happy for you to take as long as you want so long as you stick to their budget.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Time tracking software ranges from simple timers that you can stop and start yourself to more complex programs that track your software usage and display work data in graphs and charts. </span>

### **The Benefits of Time Tracking Software**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Time tracking allows you to:</span>

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Discover and track how long your work is taking so you can work out your hourly rate. This can help guide your [freelance rates](https://freetrain.co/freelance-rates/) for future projects.</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep work within your client’s timescale and budget.</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Show your client graphical information on what you’ve been doing with your time. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Several apps that we recommend for tracking your time are:</span>
