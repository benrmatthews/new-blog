<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">stats</span>](https://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Email-Statistics-Report-2015-2019-Executive-Summary.pdf)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, over a third of the global population uses email and the number of the available email accounts has exceeded 5 billion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means that the world now lives in the era of digital communication – a trend that’s only destined to grow. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter what reasons lie behind the trend, we’ll continue to increase the number of emails we send, like it or hate it. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Email is a large complicated system, distributed among email providers, internet protocols, and users’ clients like Gmail. Like any other huge system, email will have to move to an even larger complexity, which will create a growing number of random events. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the future, email will appear even more chaotic than it does now, through a failure to manage expanding email flows. </span>

![More messages more chaos](../uploads/2018/01/More-messages-more-chaos.png)

**More messages means more email chaos** 
-----------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless you refuse to use email completely, you will receive more and more “trash” messages. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In such a situation, the only method remaining for recipients to resist the mailing chaos is to neglect many emails reaching their inboxes. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ignoring irrelevant messages, you can easily make it a habit of marking emails as spam – even if those emails are not spam at all. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This should be a wake-up call to email marketers whose business depends on the deliverability of emails. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the open rate and conversion will go down when recipients are unable to distinguish the spam messages from legitimate emails. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What measures should the email marketers undertake to protect their recipients from the approaching bulk mailing chaos? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The following expert advice from the professional bulk sending platform </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">SendPulse</span>](https://sendpulse.com/)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help you get a grasp on the issue.</span>

**How to cope with email chaos**
--------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s consider three most annoying email-related phenomena along with the “antidotes” to them. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What do we hate most of all about emails? How does it relate to the growing total number of emails circulating worldwide? And what do email marketers do with all of this? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Each “mailing bugbear” has an implicit chaotic nature that should be managed by both the understanding of their real reasons and the advantages provided by the professional bulk sending platforms. </span>

![Email spam](../uploads/2018/01/Email-spam.jpg)
------------------------------------------------

### **Spam Email**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Spam is </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">marked</span>](https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/top-8-things-we-hate-about-email.html)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 81% of the recipients as the biggest problem they face checking their inboxes. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not too easy to measure the actual number of spam messages reaching our mailboxes every day. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the number is tremendous in any case, since the number of the existing email accounts is calculated in billions. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just imagine what huge amount of energy the humankind spend every day for nothing when billions of spam messages appearing in our mailboxes are to be deleted. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The psychological explanation of why the majority hate spam is quite simple: spam messages are not </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">personal</span>](https://sendpulse.com/features/email/merge)<span style="font-weight: 400;">. They are for everybody and for nobody at the same time. </span>


### **Spam creates disorder**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In most cases, spam has nothing to do with what we are interested in – spammers hope that the subjects they promote via spam messages can occasionally catch the attention of just a tiny percentage of the audience. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Needless to say that such a practice has an extremely low efficiency, if any, unlike the significant disruption spam creates for us. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Should email marketers categorically refuse spamming at all? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, they should – especially since the contemporary bulk sending platforms provide them with much more efficient and legitimate approaches and techniques. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not so much a matter of ethics, more of the effectiveness of email campaigns.</span>

###  ![Personalization eliminates spam](../uploads/2018/01/Personalization-eliminates-spam.png)

### **Personalization eliminates spam**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Email customization is the main method to prevent your email messages from being marked as spam. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Make your message personal addressing your recipients by name. People appreciate the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">personalized approach</span>](https://sendpulse.com/features/email/merge)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to email communication even if the subject of a message can stand quite far from their current interests. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">SendPulse offers various capabilities making email campaigns highly personalized including the efficient processing of user bases where names of the recipients are listed through the correctly organized </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">opt-in procedures</span>](https://sendpulse.com/features/email/subscription-forms)<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

###  ![Irrelevant emails](../uploads/2018/01/Irrelevant-emails.png)

### **Irrelevant emails**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So-called irrelevant emails are different from the pure spam, but they constitute a secondary problem only by size. </span>

[<span style="font-weight: 400;">About 66%</span>](https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/top-8-things-we-hate-about-email.html)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> of email recipients suffer from the irrelevant emails regardless of the particular content the messages contain. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the types of the irrelevant emails may significantly vary, quite a significant part of them relates to the inner correspondence between staff and their teammates.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to some </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">surveys</span>](https://www.igloosoftware.com/campaigns/getting_the_message/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, about half of workers communicating via email receive only 20% messages that are truly relevant to their working day. </span>

###  ![Irrelevant promotion destroys reputation](../uploads/2018/01/Irrelevant-promotion-destroys-reputation.jpg)

### **Irrelevant promotions destroys reputation**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another big class of the irrelevant emails belongs to the conversation between brands and their customers. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Promotional email campaigns sent by brands without regard for the actual interests of their consumers can significantly tarnish the reputation of those brands. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> And the opposite approach to sending irrelevant messages is to use professional sending systems such as SendPulse, which offer </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">trigger emails</span>](https://sendpulse.com/features/email/automation-360)<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

### ![Trigger emails are purely relevant](../uploads/2018/01/Trigger-emails-are-purely-relevant.png)

### **Trigger emails are highly relevant**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Trigger email campaigns are highly relevant to customer interests because of the very optimal algorithm used.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Trigger emails match the actual behaviour of customers on the ecommerce sites and websites, which determines both the content and timing of the messages created in reaction to the customers’ actions on those sites. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Automation 360 system provided by SendPulse allows email marketers to customize their campaigns to a great extent, as well as to arrange automated mailing flows according to the trigger events made by the recipients. </span>

###  ![Delayed response](../uploads/2018/01/Delayed-response.jpg)

### **Dealing with delayed response**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet another email-induced problem relates to the mailing process that is particular to some types of messages. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem can be called “untimely feedback” or “delayed response”, showing the annoyance factor resulting from the unsatisfied expectations due to various interruptions happening in a peer-to-peer email conversation. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We feel frustrated when our recipients do not reply. That’s why 48% of the people actively using email consider a long wait for a response a big problem. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation gets worse when it comes to email marketing. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When subscribers do not receive a welcome email just after the opt-in procedure they can easily lose confidence in the brand from which they want to either receive newsletters or get some preferences. </span>

###  ![Care about your customers](../uploads/2018/01/Care-about-your-customers.png)

### **Care about your customers**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In these days of severe market competition, every company has to fight for the attention of each customer. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The above-mentioned personal approach to email conversation implies collecting as much information from the recipients as possible.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> That’s why email marketers must appreciate every piece of data received from the customers when they react to the email campaigns.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the response-provoking content of the emails, the very mailing process should be arranged in a manner to let customers know that a brand cares about them all the time. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A series of post-subscription welcome emails, for example, can significantly increase a customers’ loyalty and show a brand as a dynamic, responsive, and responsible partner. </span>

###  ![Immediate reaction matters](../uploads/2018/01/Immediate-reaction-matters.png)

### **Immediate reaction matters**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Properly arranged automated mailing flows react immediately to every action the subscribers perform on a website, which is an effective method for increasing the customers’ satisfaction since the delayed feedback from a brand is managed. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A sufficient level of automation necessary to meet the customers’ expectations is achievable only with the help of a professional sending platforms like SendPulse. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The flexibility and responsiveness of feedback-provoking campaigns – such as welcome emails and abandoned shopping carts emails – are provided by the advanced features of the Automation 360 system, developed esepcially for making transactional email flows smooth and immediate. </span>


### **Conclusion**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever happens next, email communication will remain an inseparable part of contemporary business and social environments for the foreseeable future.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The billions of existing email accounts, along with a highly complicated email infrastructure, creates email chaos – leading to a negative user experience. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most annoying factors include spam, irrelevant messages, and delayed responses. Both the average email user and email marketers suffer from the inability to deal with those chaotic factors – unless they use professional sending platforms, such as SendPulse, which provides them with the highly-effective tools and techniques to manage their mailing flows in a flexible and responsive manner. </span>
