<span style="font-weight: 400;">Service delivery and marketing has shifted to the internet and mobile services. The introduction of these digital technologies has made delivery of services easy and fast. Customers are very important in any business, maintaining a good relationship ensures growth and success of an organization. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In appreciation of excellent work from companies, there are </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">awards</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Award)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> offered to the best performing organizations in CRM. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These awards are divided into two:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  
</span>

**1. CRM Market Awards**
------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This award acknowledges rising stars, influential leaders, elite practitioners, and leading vendors. This is determined by customer satisfaction, functions of products, revenue, growth of the organization, and market shares. You can get more details about various awards on </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.salesforce.com/ap/company/awards/</span>](https://www.salesforce.com/ap/company/awards/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  
</span>

**2. CRM Service Awards**<span style="font-weight: 400;">  
</span>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This award recognizes rising stars and leading vendors who are the best in customer service deployment. Vendors are rated based on performance for the last 12 months based on product services and customer satisfaction, revenue growth, and market shares. Representatives get data from various sources and determine which company offers good services and handling cases efficiently.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ratings and search engines provide information from contact agents; this includes e-learning, analytics, performance management, quality monitoring, and workforce management. Contact centers work closely to get good and fast results. With the use of the internet, customers can visit websites and get answers instead of relying on customer service centers. This is effective, saves time, and </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">customers get reliable information</span>](http://customerthink.com/7-top-customer-information-sources/)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> much faster.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The organization that has the best web content is selected through a competitive process. With the development of IVR apps which handle information related to callers on the screen of a computer by using touch tone keypad and voice input, there is growing competition from organizations because this response comes in the form of call back, email, fax, and voice. Call centers need a technology package that operates much faster and in an efficient way. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With more developments in the digital industry, there are new innovations every day from different organizations. In the management of enterprise feedback, customers use software that gives feedback from clients to the organization. This ensures that there are no loopholes in responding to customer complaints and conversations.</span>

**CRM Rising Star Awards**<span style="font-weight: 400;">  
</span>
--------------------------------------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This award recognizes mergers and acquisitions and vendors who have succeeded in the emerging markets. It’s for new emerging organizations whose products have left a good mark in the market sectors. This encourages innovation in the sector.</span>

**CRM Service Elite Awards**<span style="font-weight: 400;">  
</span>
----------------------------------------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This award is for companies that embrace different options like virtual agents, messaging and chats. They benefit by reducing the cost of operations and staying up to date with client’s wants and needs. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce is one of the best CRM companies in the world. It is a leading cloud computing organization which offers CRM services by providing software solutions for their users. They use networked computers to process and store digital information which can be accessed anywhere in the world through internet connection.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With Salesforce CRM software, there is constant workflow on Appcloud where everything is available, providing an opportunity to customize various business processes like sales and marketing. Most companies use Salesforce to close deals since it’s much faster and convenient. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer satisfaction is important for any organization and every organization that performs well deserves an award. This ensures there is fair competition and development of new technologies.</span>
