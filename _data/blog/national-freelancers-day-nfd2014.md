![national-freelancers-day](http://benrmatthews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/national-freelancers-day-720x183.png)

Wednesday 19 November 2014 marks the sixth[ National Freelancers Day](http://www.nationalfreelancersday.com/) (here in the UK anyway).

Over the last six years National Freelancers Day has been celebrating the rise of freelancing and cultivating a nurturing environment for freelancers. According to [IPSE](http://www.ipse.co.uk/), the organisers behind the day, there are now almost five million self-employed people working in the UK which means [15% of the workforce are now choosing to earn their living as freelancers](http://benrmatthews.com/2014/09/freelance-statistics-2014/ "Freelance Statistics 2014: The Freelance Economy in Numbers").

This year their headline event takes place in London, right in the heart of Tech City. Manchester and Edinburgh will also play host to celebrations of their own, while on [the website](http://www.nationalfreelancersday.com/) they will be hosting live streams and interactive discussions throughout the day.

You can also follow along with National Freelancers Day by using the hashtag [\#NFD2014](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23NFD2014&src=typd), so there’s plenty of ways to get involved.

To join in with National Freelancers Day, I thought I’d take inspiration from Reddit’s famous Ask Me Anything feature, where everyone from [Barack Obama](http://www.reddit.com/comments/z1c9z) to [Bill Murray](http://www.reddit.com/comments/1vhjag) has invited people to ask them anything.

I really love getting question from readers, so would enjoy helping out even more by answering questions that any of you might have.

For example, Laura and I got into a discussion on [negotiating freelance rates with clients](http://benrmatthews.com/2014/11/negotiating-freelance-rates-clients/ "Negotiating freelance rates with clients: tips to get your best fee") and[ tips to get your best fee](http://benrmatthews.com/2014/11/negotiating-freelance-rates-clients/ "Negotiating freelance rates with clients: tips to get your best fee").

What challenges are you experiencing this National Freelancers Day?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Let me know. I’d love to lend a hand!

If you’d like, you can leave a comment on this post and your questions will go straight to me.

Or you can email me directly [using the contact details here](http://benrmatthews.com/contact/ "Contact").

It’d be great to hear your unique experience and questions on freelancing. I’ll do my best to put together some ideas for you, via a blog post here or through email.

I’m excited to help out the best I can this National Freelancers Day!
