![Freelance Essentials](http://benrmatthews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Top_view-720x450.jpg "Freelance Essentials")

Before you make the leap, there are some freelance essentials that you should have before you launch your new freelance career.

While sometimes boring and time-consuming to set up, the more work you put into getting these essentials set up now, the easier your life will be once you get into the more important aspects of getting your client work done and keeping them happy!

### Freelance Bank Account

First off, the exciting bit! Where the funds go when you get paid by your clients.

[The Santander Start Up Business Account](https://www.santander.co.uk/csgs/Satellite?appID=abbey.internet.Abbeycom&cid=1237898427431&leng=en_GB&pagename=Abbeycom%2FPage%2FWC_ACOM_TemplateW2) offers unlimited free day-to-day transactions for a year – or 18 months if you’re already a Santander customer. After the end of the free period, you can choose from four different fees between £7.50 and £40 per month depending on monthly cash deposit withdrawal limits.

[NatWest’s Start-ups package](http://www.business.natwest.com/afb/public/nwb/AFBRoot/mainhome/startups) has two years of free unlimited transaction banking. After that, you revert to their standard tariff, at which point you pay per transaction. You can open the account if you started trading within the last 12 months, and the company’s turnover is less than £1 million.

These two accounts are effectively just like consumer bank accounts, but for business. The others charge more for you to bank with them or don’t offer the same benefits.

There’s more background reading on Small Business Bank Accounts over on [Money Saving Expert](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/banking/small-business#acc).

### Freelance Insurance

Depending on the area you work in, you’ll either need general public liability insurance or more comprehensive cover if you work with equipment or on location.

If you do work with expensive equipment or you’re on the road a lot, look for a company that offers automatic cover for your portable equipment and public liability, whether you are: on location, in transit or at your home. Also look for Free of charge cover for accidental loss or damage to office contents and equipment, employers’ liability cover and personal accident insurance.

If you’ve got a laptop or smartphone, make sure to get those covered too – you don’t want to be without either for too long as a freelancer, as they’re more critical to your work than you might think!

I’ve gone with [AON](http://www.rewritinginsurance.aon.co.uk/freelance-professionals.aspx), who offer affordable [insurance for freelancers](http://www.rewritinginsurance.aon.co.uk/freelance-professionals.aspx), but there are a range of other providers out there.

### Freelance Accountant

An excellent accountant is an essential aspect of your new freelance career and worth every penny you spend on them (and they’ll save you a few pennies too…).

I love using [Crunch](http://crunch.co.uk/), the online accountants who have a simple to use online system to log all your day-to-day invoices and expenditure, as well as dedicated telephone and email support for all those niggling queries you have.

(Plus we both get £25 Amazon vouchers if you [sign up to Crunch using this link!](http://www.crunch.co.uk/?c2c=bm14164m))

I’ve also worked with [The Proactive Accountant](http://www.proactive.uk.net/), honest and trusted accountants based in London in case you need more human contact for your financial goings on.

How you set your freelance essentials up is down to you and your personal preferences, but these areas and links will hopefully have given you something to think about.

And if you haven’t thought about this yet, there’s no time like the present to get going!
