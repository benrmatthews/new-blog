[![Freelance in 30 Days](http://benrmatthews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/freelance-book.png)](http://benrmatthews.com/freelance-in-30-days/ "Freelance in 30 Days: Get the confidence and knowledge to succeed at going freelance")

Today is my 30th birthday.

Yes, I’ve reached the big three-oh.

I can already see wrinkles appearing by the minute…

To celebrate, I’ve been whisked away for a surprise trip and I’m writing this from the cosy bedroom aboard a boat. One of the advantages of freelancing is that you can take a trip whenever suits you and you can work while you’re there, if you’ve set yourself up for mobile working.

I’ll be writing more about travelling as a freelancer and how to make it work in the coming weeks. This year I’ve been to Japan, India, Germany, Spain , and the US, all while still running my freelance consulting business.

While I’m on this particular trip, I’m planning to put the finishing touches to my book, [Freelance in 30 Days](http://benrmatthews.com/freelance-in-30-days/ "Freelance in 30 Days: Get the confidence and knowledge to succeed at going freelance").

And to celebrate my 30th birthday, I’m giving you a present (that’s how generous a guy I am!)

From now until December 30th, I’m offering 30% off the normal book price. Simply enter the code ‘happybirthday’ when prompted.

**That’s 30% off [Freelance in 30 Days](http://benrmatthews.com/freelance-in-30-days/ "Freelance in 30 Days: Get the confidence and knowledge to succeed at going freelance") until the 30th to celebrate my 30th.**

That’s a lot of 30s…

The book itself is being published later this week on December 19th, but you can [preorder it now](http://benrmatthews.com/freelance-in-30-days/ "Freelance in 30 Days: Get the confidence and knowledge to succeed at going freelance"). And I’ll be sure to tell you again when the book itself has been published so you can get yourself a copy.

It would be a lovely birthday present if I could sell a few copies of my first book, but an even bigger present for you if you buy the book, follow the advice and then make the transition from employed to self-employed. That would be worth celebrating for me.

Ok, I’m off to open some birthday presents, but don’t forget – it’s 30% off [Freelance in 30 Days](http://benrmatthews.com/freelance-in-30-days/ "Freelance in 30 Days: Get the confidence and knowledge to succeed at going freelance") until the 30th to celebrate my 30th (just use the code ‘happybirthday’).
