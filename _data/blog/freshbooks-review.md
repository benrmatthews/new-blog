### <span id="What_is_Freshbooks">**What is Freshbooks?**</span>

[FreshBooks](https://www.freshbooks.com/) is one of the most established freelancing accounting software in the market today, having been founding back in January 2003, by the owner of a design agency who was frustrated that when it came to billing clients, Word and Excel were difficult to use and weren’t built to create professional looking invoices.

Over the past few decades, Freshbooks has grown to a comprehensive freelancing accounting platform that automates tasks like invoicing, organizing expenses, tracking time and following up with clients.

Getting start with Freshbooks is easy. Most people send their first invoice seconds after starting their free trial. The same goes for [tracking time](https://www.freshbooks.com/timesheets-and-time-tracking), [managing expenses](https://www.freshbooks.com/expenses-and-receipts-tracking), [collaborating with contractors](https://www.freshbooks.com/projects-and-collaboration) and [viewing financial reports](https://www.freshbooks.com/financial-reporting).

If you need help at any time, their [award-winning customer service](https://www.freshbooks.com/4e-philosophy) is a phone call or an email away.

You also get a 30-day money back guarantee, so you don’t have to worry about switching away from FreshBooks if it’s not right for you.

Their mobile app is also worth a mention as it’s one of the more polished apps on the market and event lets you respond to your clients’ questions and feedback right from the app so even when you’re on the go, your conversations are kept in one place.

“FreshBooks has allowed me to free up time and focus on growing my business. Thank you!” – Deric

“Freshbooks has been a program I’ve been using for several years now as they’ve made my time tracking and invoicing so much more efficient than my old school manual method of Excel and custom invoices.” – Victor

“FreshBooks should be a great product. It’s easy to use with good workflow, the UI is terrific, our customers love it and it does exactly what we want. Except … in only a few weeks’ use, we’ve encountered significant bugs including an error totalling invoices on the dashboard.” – David

“I really liked Freshbooks up until the recent updates. I find that a lot of the original functionality I found useful for business (reports, filtering etc..) have taken a hit. – Eugene

“It’s a little pricey if you have multiple businesses. Otherwise I love everything about it.”. – Matthew
