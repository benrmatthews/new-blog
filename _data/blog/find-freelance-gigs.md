![The 10 Best Sites to Find Freelance Gigs](https://freetrain.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/qleu_4xj-fk-1024x683.jpg)

More and more employees are turning to freelance jobs, either alongside a full-time freelance job or as their primary career.

A gig is a temporary freelance job and is often part-time.

Freelance gigs are particularly common in IT and creative industries but can are in almost every industry. People might do one freelance gig at a time, or do a few at once.

Finding the right freelance gig for you and your schedule can take some time. Using the right online freelance job search site can make the process easier.

Read below for more information on freelance gigs, tips for finding freelance gigs, and a list of the ten best sites to find the freelance gig for you.

What is a freelance gig?
------------------------

A freelance gig is a temporary job. The employee often works on a specific project for a company, either as an independent contractor or a freelancer. Sometimes these freelance gigs are full-time, and other times they are part-time. Some have a specific end date, while others go on.

An employee working a gig might get paid hourly, receive one lump sum for a completed project, or might receive a salary.

Some freelance gigs turn into full-time jobs, but this is not typical.

The benefits of a freelance gig are that it allows you to work on many projects for many companies at once. You can often work from home and have flexible hours. Freelance gigs is an ideal type of job for someone who is looking for part-time work.

Another benefit is that it allows you to always be open to new career opportunities. You are not tied to one job, so you can pick up new jobs as they appear.

One downside to freelance gigs is that they don’t offer health insurance or other benefits. They also aren’t as secure as other jobs, since they are temporary and often part-time. You likely need more than one freelance gig to make ends meet.

There are many freelance gigs in a variety of industries. Common IT gigs include projects for web developers and software developers. There are many creative gigs for multimedia artists, photographers, and online content writers. Other freelance gigs need the work of an interpreter, occupational therapist, analyst, or others.

How to find the right freelance gig for you
-------------------------------------------

### Make a list of your freelance skills

If you aren’t even sure what kind of gig you might want, make a list of your skills. Think about some of your responsibilities in past jobs. Do you have experience editing someone’s writing? Have you helped create or maintain a website? You likely have even more skills than you realise, so first make a list to see what you can offer companies.

### Think about your freelancing schedule

If you are planning to keep your full or part-time job, your availability for a gig will be limited. Think about when you could complete your freelance gig work. Would you have time on the weekends? Nights? Make sure you aren’t spreading yourself so thin that you sacrifice the quality of your work. Then, look for freelance gigs that allow you to work the number of hours you want when you want.

### Be willing to develop new freelance skills

Most freelance gigs will need skills that you do have, but they might also need some skills that you don’t yet have. Continue to develop skills that are necessary for the gigs you want. For example, you might have to learn a new coding language or become familiar with new software. Show your willingness to learn new skills, and you will find more and more freelance gigs open to you.

### Avoid scams targeting freelancers

Scams are very common on freelance job sites for freelance gig positions. Be very careful to check each listing’s legitimacy.

### Make a great impression with your clients

Once you get a freelance gig, be sure to do your very best work. If you do a good job and make yourself indispensable, you will be more likely to get more work from the company for another freelance gig. It is also a good way to get a positive recommendation from an employer when you are looking for your next gig.
