**What are the benefits of freelancing?**
-----------------------------------------

So what did the FlexJobs survey find?

Let’s find out the four biggest benefits of freelancing, according to a FlexJobs survey.

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4518" class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_4518" style="width: 750px">![A flexible schedule is the most popular benefit of freelancing](https://freetrain.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/78t99kbcp_4-1024x683.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-4518">A flexible schedule is the most popular benefit of freelancing</figcaption></figure>

**Flexible schedule**
---------------------

The top benefit of freelancing, according to our FlexJobs survey, is the [freedom that comes with a flexible schedule](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/flexible-schedule).

84% of respondents listed a flexible schedule as the reason they look for work flexibility in a job search.

**Work-life balance**
---------------------

The second most popular benefit of freelancing, according to our survey, is work-life balance.

66% of people who responded said finding the right balance between career and personal life goals was a major reason to look for freelance work.

The term “work-life balance” has come under increasing scrutiny, with “work-life rhythm” as one new characterisation.

The goal is the same: making it all blend in a way that works for you.

**Freedom to work where you want**
----------------------------------

Our survey found that 61% of freelance job seekers said that freedom to work from anywhere was a top motivator.

The appeal of [freelance jobs](https://freetrain.co/freelance-jobs/) that also offer scheduling flexibility holds an undeniable appeal for job seekers who want to capitalise on all of the best benefits of freelancing.

**No commute**
--------------

Who doesn’t want to avoid a long commute?

Breaking free from a gruelling trek to and from work is a major benefit of freelancing, according to 60% of respondents to the FlexJobs survey.

And of course, ditching a commute comes with tremendous side benefits, including saving money and helping the environment.

**7 more benefits of freelancing**
----------------------------------

Here are a few more of the great benefits of freelancing from the FlexJobs survey:

1. **Self-development.** Some 39% of survey respondents said having the time to work on self-development, from career-related initiatives to personal goals, was a big draw to working as a freelancer.
2. **No dressing up for work**. Every day is “casual Friday” if you work from home. FlexJobs’ survey showed that 38% of people who responded placed a high value on being able to “dress down” every day while working as a freelancer.
3. **Ability to travel.** According to our survey, 38% of respondents wanted the freedom to travel without being tethered to a physical location. Often, freelancers can continue to work from remote locations, or choose to take time off.
4. **Better productivity.** In study after study, researchers have found that people who work remotely (including freelancers) are more productive. In the FlexJobs survey, 34% of respondents said one of the benefits of freelancing was being more productive.
5. **Flexible vacation.** The flexibility to take time off when it suits you? That’s one of the best benefits of freelancing, according to 33% of respondents.
6. **Getting to meet new people.** Working for one employer can put you in a rut when it comes to personal interactions, which can include [networking](https://freetrain.co/grow-your-freelance-network/).

7. **Financial advantages.** The survey found that 27% of respondents concluded that there were definite financial [advantages to working as a freelancer](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/312694), based on their personal financial circumstances.
