<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a freelancer is interesting and exciting; it provides an excellent opportunity to work as you wish and earn a handful of income. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But, the tight competition makes it tough to succeed in the freelance market. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Good numbers of newcomers are really worried about expert freelancers stealing all of the good jobs from the platform. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no need to worry since it is not a tiring or impossible task to find some good clients to crush the competition. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The freelance market has thousands of projects to offer you. It is your ability and quality that helps to convert offers to valued clients. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the best tips for how freelancers win clients, beat their competition and see success a freelancer.</span>

Identify the competition
------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthy competition only can bring the best out of you as a freelancer. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t run away from the competition. Instead, identify the competition and accept it. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a good study of the projects and proposals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> See how the veteran freelancers quote the rates and bring the projects in favor of them. There are clients who give importance to quality, rates, or both. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Study how to identify them and convince them. This is the first thing you have to follow when providing freelance services. </span>

Build a better portfolio
------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is another factor that helps your clients to go through your works. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reputed and busy clients may not be interested in checking several links and downloading big files. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, send them a single link to your website where the best of your works are showcased neatly for them. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Make the portfolio with only the best works you have done for the clients. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never put all of the works in the portfolio since it can make it look cluttered.</span>

Carefully select your clients
-----------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There could find several bitter experiences for the freelancers with the payment. Hence, select the clients who give importance to quality work than cheap rates. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are so sure about the quality and commitment of your work, have some patience to find the best clients. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Freelancer platforms can help bring good clients for you. Check for the genuineness of the client using various online forums. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is how you can select the right client who can generate better projects for you.</span>

Give more importance to long-term projects
------------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a serious and not a time pass freelancer, try to get long-term projects with better payment frequency. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This keeps you engaged in the work for a good period of time without wasting a lot of time in project search. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several clients who look for trusted and committed freelancers, who can provide continuous services at better rates. Be among one of them to become a successful freelancer.</span>

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5182" class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_5182" style="width: 750px">![Your communication skills play an important role in winning good clients from freelancer platforms.](https://freetrain.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/jxuuxxuffp4-1024x768.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-5182">Your communication skills play an important role in winning good clients from freelancer platforms.</figcaption></figure>

Improve your communication skills
---------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be nice and friendly to the clients than approaching them with frustration. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Make use of simple and short words when sending emails instead of using complicated words and detailed technical explanations. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your communication skills certainly play an important role in bringing and sustaining good clients from freelancer platforms. </span>

Keep learning
-------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Never think that you know everything once you complete the first project. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology and expectations of the targeted clients and customers change frequently. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep learning about the latest happenings in your field to be a competent freelancer. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Make the effort to provide something different and unique for the clients that others can’t. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Treat every project as the first one and your own project to deliver the best out of your talents, skills, and technical excellence to make it the best one.</span>

Client needs a solution, not just advice
----------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of the clients posts the jobs or proposals to find the right person to provide the best solution. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, at least spend a few minutes to read the project description carefully since most of the clients will have their unique needs and expectation. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the freelancers just go through the introduction and show the interest. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one of the big mistakes and reasons why freelancers miss good projects and clients. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Go through the proposal in detail, make some research, have a better idea and then write a pitch on how you can provide the best in service.</span>

Prepare proposals with a professional touch
-------------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Write the proposal for the clients with a professional touch. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposals can work just like a mirror, and it can show your knowledge and experience in work. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It creates a good impression about you and your services in the mind of clients, which is so crucial in building a long-lasting relationship. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can go through different proposal templates and samples to get an idea about how to write a professional proposal that convinces the client.</span>

Take on multiple clients to reduce risk
---------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep two or three genuine clients to keep the work rotating without taking hard efforts and sleepless nights. </span>
