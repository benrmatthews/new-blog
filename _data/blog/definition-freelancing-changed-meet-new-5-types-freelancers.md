![definition of freelancer](http://benrmatthews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/definition-of-freelancer-720x395.png)

There are many different variations on [how freelancers are working](http://benrmatthews.com/2013/03/freelance-consultant/ "How freelance consultants are working") and defining their work today.

<span class="var"><span class="var">According to the [Collins English Dictionary](http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/freelance), “a freelancer is</span></span><span class="def"> a self-employed person, especially a writer or artist, who is not employed continuously but hired to do specific assignments.”</span>

Seems fairly straightforward to me.

But [a new report](http://freelancersunion.org/53million "Freelancers Union - 53 Million") argues that is there are now 5 different types of freelancer and that there are more than 53 million Americans are doing freelance work – a sixth of the U.S. population.

Starting with the general U.S. workforce, each survey respondent went through a series of questions that qualified their employment status and income in order to definitions of freelancing that might otherwise go unrecorded.

Here is how the report breaks down the new types of freelancers.

### <span id="1_Independent_Contractors">1. Independent Contractors</span>

![Independent Contractors](http://benrmatthews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-11.39.33.png)

*(40% of the independent workforce / 21.1 million professionals)*

These “traditional” freelancers don’t have an employer and instead do freelance, temporary, or supplemental work on a project- to-project basis.

### <span id="2_Moonlighters">2. Moonlighters</span>

![Moonlighters](http://benrmatthews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-11.39.40.png)

*(27% of the independent workforce/ 14.3 million professionals)*

Professionals with a primary, traditional job who also moonlight doing freelance work. For example, a corporate- employed web developer who also does projects for non-profits in the evening.

### <span id="3_Diversified_workers">3. Diversified workers</span>

![Diversified Workers](http://benrmatthews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-11.39.46.png)

*(18% of the independent workforce/ 9.3 million professionals)*

People with multiple sources of income from a mix of traditional employers and freelance work. For example, someone who works the front desk at a dentist’s office 20 hours a week and fills out the rest of his income driving for Uber and doing freelance writing.

### <span id="4_Temporary_Workers">4. Temporary Workers</span>

![Temporary Workers](http://benrmatthews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-11.39.53.png)

*(10% of the independent workforce/ 5.5 million professionals)*

Individuals with a single employer, client, job, or contract project where their employment status is temporary. For example, a business strategy consultant working for one startup client on a contract basis for a months-long project.

### <span id="5_Freelance_Business_Owners">5. Freelance Business Owners</span>

![Freelance Business Owners](http://benrmatthews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-11.39.59.png)

*(5% of the independent workforce / 2.8 million professionals)*

Business owners with between one and five employees who consider themselves both a freelancer and a business owner. For example, a social marketing guru who hires a team of other social marketers to build a small agency, but still identifies as a freelancer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The report argues that “the old way of working isn’t working”, that more than 53 million workers in the U.S. are “showing a new way”. But are these numbers accurate?

As you can see from the 5 types of freelancer above, the survey groups together moonlighters and temporary workers, 19.8 million that would have previously fallen outside of the definition of a freelancer.

The diversified workers group is also a new addition to the definition of freelancing. With 9.8 million in this group, these people might previously have been categorised as part-time workers – working multiple jobs to make up a full time equivalent (and that’s before we get into issues such as [zero-hour contracts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-hour_contract "Zero-hour contracts")).

If you take the above groups away, you come to perhaps a more traditional number of Freelance Business Owners and Independent Contractors, which is 23.9m or 8% of the US workforce – 45% of the number the survey is suggesting are “freelance”.

I’ll leave it up to you to decide which is the more accurate definition of a freelancer and just how many people can count themselves as freelance, but the survey results worth a flick through for insight into how freelancers across the US view their freelance work and prospects.

Here’s the full presentation of the survey results from the Freelancing in America report:
