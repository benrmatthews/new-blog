<span id="My_best_freelance_tools">**My best freelance tools**</span>
---------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve been looking at the products and services I use as a freelancer, so wanted to get some advice and other opinions on what freelance tools are the best to use.

I’ve become a big fan of the [Freelance Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/ "Freelance Reddit"), which has a whole community of freelancers, so I asked “[What’s your freelance stack?](http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/2e5xe9/whats_your_freelance_stack/)” to try to get an idea of what other freelancers use in their work.

I got a ton of responses – not just from the web development crowd. There were some popular apps, products and services that came up time and again – Gmail, Dropbox, Trello – but the discussion highlighted lots of services in different areas of freelancing that are worth taking a look at?

To kick things off, I listed my freelance stack – the tools I use everyday as a productive freelancer:

- **Computer:** Mac Air 11″
- **Email:** Gmail
- **Word processing:** Google Docs (or Open Office if I know the client uses Microsoft Word)
- **Accounting software:** Crunch.co.uk
- **Project Management:** Trello
- **To do list:** Clear App (and good old pen and paper)
- **Website / blog:** WordPress
- **Hosting:** A Small Orange
- **File sharing:** Dropbox / WeTransfer

Many of these apps you will have heard of, so it’s a pretty standard setup and there are not too many surprises in there.

<span id="Recommended_freelance_tools">**Recommended freelance tools**</span>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are the tools the freelance community on Reddit recommended using. And if they’re established freelancers, you get the confidence that you’ll enjoy using these tools as well.

*(Click on the name of the app go to their website, pricing based on freelancers or small business rates. Where available, prices in US dollars because that’s where most of the services are based)*

### <span id="Best_Time-Tracking_Softwarefor_Freelancers">**Best Time-Tracking Software** **for Freelancers**</span>

- **[Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com/ "Harvest") (Free-$99 per month):** Simple time tracking, fast online invoicing, and powerful reporting software. One of the most recommended tools, Harvest simplifies timesheets and billing so you can get on with your freelance work.
- **[RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/dashboard) (Free-$9 per month):** Freelancers need as there’s no one on your back telling you to do work. RescueTime helps you understand your daily habits so you can focus and be a more productive freelancer.
- **[ManicTime](http://www.manictime.com/ "Manic Time") (Free-$67 for a full license):** ManicTime sits in the background and records your activities, so you can just forget it is there and focus on your work. It’s Windows only, but a good alternative to RescueTime.
- **[Toggl](https://www.toggl.com/ "Toggl") (Free-$5 per month):** Toggl is a simple time tracking tool, which has many similar features to RescueTime, but not with the added features of Harvest, so is a happy medium. They also offer free timesheet and mobile apps for Android and iOS.
- **[Pancake](https://pancakeapp.com/ "Pancake App") (Free-$179 for **a full license**):** Pancake is a tool that handles not only the freelance basics (time tracking, invoicing) but includes more features like project cost tracking, proposal generation and estimates.

- **[Crunch](http://www.crunch.co.uk/ "Crunch") ($80 per month):** The UK equivalent of US giants Freshbooks and Quickbooks. Plus with added phone support, so you know you always have an accountant waiting at the end of the line (which is why it’s slightly more expensive)

- **[Open Office](https://www.openoffice.org/ "Open Office") (Free):** The open source alternative to Microsoft Office. Great if your clients send you MS Word docs and you don’t want to pay the license fee, but beware of formatting issues. “Export as PDF” is your new best friend.
