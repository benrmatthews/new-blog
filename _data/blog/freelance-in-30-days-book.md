So who’s behind Freelance in 30 Days?

Hey, I’m Ben Matthews, a freelance digital consultant and author.

Through consulting with these fantastic clients, I gained the knowledge and expertise to be a successful freelancer, spelled out in Freelance in 30 Days. My goal is to help others get the confidence to make the jump and go freelance.

<span id="WHY_HAVE_I_WRITTEN_FREELANCE_IN_30_DAYS">**WHY HAVE I WRITTEN FREELANCE IN 30 DAYS?**</span>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 2008 I left my job working for one of London’s fastest growing digital agencies to start my freelance consulting business.

Now I’m one half of a successful digital marketing consultancy business, working alongside my wife to run digital marketing, content marketing and social media campaigns for clients.

There are many similar stories out there. Established consultants leaving their jobs making a viable success as a freelancer, all within a matter of weeks.

Unlike the monotony of a day job or the day-to-day stress of agency life, building up your own freelance consulting business is possible for most of us. Freelancing requires consistent hard work and focus, but those things are within your control and you are more than capable of achieving success as a freelance consultant.

<span id="FREELANCING_ISNT_JUST_ABOUT_THE_MONEY">**FREELANCING ISN’T JUST ABOUT THE MONEY**</span>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Making money as a freelancer is wonderful—but it is only one benefit. Working with the clients you want to work with, having the flexibility to work when you want, and having the freedom to work where you want are all common side effects of being a freelance consultant.

In my practical new book, I’ll help you to get started and succeed throughout all stages of the launching your career as a freelance consultant.
