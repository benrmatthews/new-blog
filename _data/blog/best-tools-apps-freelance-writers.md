![10 Best Tools and Apps for Freelance Writers](https://freetrain.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tznbaktucti.jpg)

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing about freelance writing is that most of the time you have only yourself to count on. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no office with a dozen other employees to whom you can run to when you encounter a problem. Thankfully, technology has given us something else besides an easier way to hunt writing jobs.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> It has given us some helpful tools and apps.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t matter if you like to stick to a particular niche or you like to experiment with different types of writing. In either way, the right tools can help you to grow your business. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering that it can be hard to choose which apps and tools to use, this list of the best of them will save you some troubles. </span>

**1.** [**BaseCamp**](https://basecamp.com/)
--------------------------------------------

![Basecamp](https://freetrain.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bacecamp.jpg-2.jpg)

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a freelancer, you need to be your own secretary, personal assistant, and organizer. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a project management tool such as BaseCamp can really help you to juggle all the responsibilities.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Use BaseCamp to keep track of your priorities and organize your workload. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The useful features it offers are:</span>

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">To-do-lists</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Calendaring</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping track of the due dates </span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">File-sharing</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The app also has a calendar view so you’ll always have a clear overview of your obligations. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With these options, you’ll be able to follow up with all your projects and easily stick to the deadlines. </span>

**2.** [**Evernote**](https://evernote.com/)
--------------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In case you haven’t already heard about this awesome tool, it is time that we change that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone needs a handy note-taking tool to keep all their thoughts in one place. Evernote is all that and more.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This app can be the place where you do your brainstorming, organize your ideas, write blog posts, write down details about your job assignments, and so much more.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is completely free so there is really no reason why you shouldn’t at least try it out. </span>

**3.** [**Freshbooks**](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1287346&u=1840782&m=52946&urllink=&afftrack=)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[![freshbooks](https://freetrain.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/freshbooks-3.png)](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1287346&u=1840782&m=52946&urllink=&afftrack=)

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If your biggest struggle is keeping track of your finances and incomes from different projects, this tool is a perfect choice.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is available both on your computer and your cellphone so you can access it at any time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[Freshbooks](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1287346&u=1840782&m=52946&urllink=&afftrack=) can track and manage your money and time through the whole process, from getting the job to getting paid. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can monitor your income, keep track of your expenses, create invoices, and track your time. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you can be your own accountant as well!</span>

**4.** [**CoSchedule Headline Analyzer**](https://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a good headline, you will never be able to attract the attention of your audience. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">An effective headline is the first step towards sparking interest in your readers and driving traffic.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What this headline analyzer does is that it scores your headline based on the words you use. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you use power words, original wording, or emotion-based wording, your score will be higher.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All you need to do is to type in your headline and wait for the result. It will even give you suggestions and tips on how to improve it.</span>

**5.** [**Grammarly**](https://app.grammarly.com/)
--------------------------------------------------

![grammarly](https://freetrain.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/grammarly-4.png)

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every writer needs a good proofreading tool and Grammarly can be your choice.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two options. You can either go for a free version or for a paid version. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the paid version gives you more detailed proofreading but you can always start with the free option and then upgrade it if you like it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Grammarly shows you all the errors and mistakes in your copy and gives suggestions on how to change it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It also calculates the performance score, word count, and text readability.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While having someone to edit your work is the best option if you want to provide high-quality service, using a tool such as Grammarly can really help you to perfect your copy.</span>

**6.** [**WoWGrade**](https://wowgrade.net/do-my-paper-for-me)
--------------------------------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also use it to when you want to write down some work ideas but you don’t have the time for writing. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">DragonDication can be like your personal typewriter. </span>

**10.** [**ZenPen**](https://zenpen.io/)

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This useful tool can really help you to get in the writing zone. </span>
