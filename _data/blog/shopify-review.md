**How to setup your first Shopify store**
-----------------------------------------

<span>Shopify is undoubtedly one of the most popular and superior site-building platforms for businesses looking to enter the e-commerce world. </span>

<span>However, there are a few crucial elements to keep in mind when creating your store; some of these determine the functionality and overall performance of your store in the e-commerce market.</span>

<span>From acquiring a Shopify domain to choosing efficient shipping methods, here are some actionable steps on how to set up your Shopify web store.</span>

- <span>Acquiring a Shopify domain and email hosting</span>

<span>The first step to establishing your brand on Shopify is buying a domain. </span>

<span>However, if you have an existing domain from a third party provider, you can use it for your e-commerce store by transferring or connecting it to Shopify.</span>

<span>After acquiring a Shopify domain, you can proceed to configure a hosting service for your Shopify store.</span>

<span>Unfortunately, this e-commerce software does not provide its own email hosting service which means you’ll need to acquire services of a third-party company for the service.</span>

<span>This dedicated</span>[<span> </span><span>Shopify email hosting</span>](https://shopped.email/)<span> provider is a great place to start especially if you need a service that offers you unlimited email addresses for your custom domain.</span>

- <span>Choosing a Shopify theme</span>

<span>As mentioned earlier, Shopify offers a wide range of templates (themes) to choose from; you’ll never have to worry about finding an amazing theme for your store regardless of your market specialization.</span>

<span>Be sure to browse through the hundreds of templates with a keen eye on the demos to find one that reflects the value of products on your Shopify store.</span>

<span>Remember, the key to</span>[<span> </span><span>choosing an appropriate theme</span>](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/309735)<span> that suits your online store is looking past the aesthetics; you also need to consider other crucial factors like its load speed and whether it supports all the key functionalities you’re looking for in a store.</span>

<span>Although Shopify templates are categorized by markets, the best approach to choosing one is testing out as many demos across these markets as possible to find one with the right functionalities and key usability features.</span>

- <span>Creating Shopify Collections, Tags and Filters</span>

<span>After customizing a Shopify template to your needs, it’s time to start thinking about the products you will be importing into your web store. </span>

<span>The first step here is to iron out your collections tagging options, filtering choices, and product types.</span>

<span>This makes uploading the products easier and consistent.</span>

<span>Shopify collections (categories) are a very powerful tool in your web store when created carefully.</span>

<span>A collection provides two options for adding your products – manual importation for a small inventory and automatic which works best for a large inventory.</span>

<span>To add products to your collection automatically, you’ll need to set some conditions.</span>

<span>Conditions are simple case sensitive statements that may take the form: “Product Type X is equal to Accessories Y”.</span>

<span>This way, any product of type X added to the store automatically falls into a category of accessories named Y.</span>

<span>Conditions are not limited to product type; they can also be based on price, vendor, inventory, tags, color, size, and so on.</span>

<span>These are incredibly important when creating filter options for products on your collections.</span>

<span>Planning your Shopify collections, tags and filtering options in a spreadsheet will make the process much easier. Remember that consistency is the key when creating collections and adding products to your store.</span>

- <span>Shopify Shipping Options and Strategies</span>

<span>One final tip – it’s important to determine your</span>[<span> </span><span>shipping strategies</span>](https://www.shopify.ca/blog/shipping-strategy)<span> early enough or else it will be a roadblock to launching your Shopify store.</span>

<span>Unless you are dealing with pure digital services that do not require shipping, you need to start figuring out the shipping methods to use the moment you start building your store.</span>

<span>Reach out to various shipping agents, discover their rates, and choose one or several that best suit your customers’ needs and locations.</span>
