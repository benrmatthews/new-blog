![free invoice generators](http://benrmatthews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/free-invoice-generators-720x288.jpg)

Presenting yourself as a [professional freelance consultant](http://benrmatthews.com/2014/09/less-freelancing-consulting-adding-value-leads-added-income/ "Less freelancing, more consulting: how adding value leads to added income") is important and there’s no better chance to give this impression than when invoicing your client, as it’s a great chance to [finish your freelance project on a high](http://benrmatthews.com/2014/09/finish-freelance-projects-high/ "Finish freelance projects on a high with these 8 client pleasers").

There are loads of free freelance invoice templates and generators out there, but which ones are the best for you?

Do you want a slick, professional looking invoice for your freelance business, but will be encouraged to sign up to other premium freelance services?

Or do you just want to generate a basic looking freelance invoice, using an editable invoice template, without being sold to while you create your freelance invoice?

I’ve looked through the options available online to help you create a professional looking freelance invoice – for free.

*(Where possible, I’ve listed if the invoice generators are completely free or if a paid freelance service is behind the site. If I’m wrong in any case, or you’ve spotted one I should add, then let me know!)*

[Crunch’s free editable PDF invoice templates](http://www.crunch.co.uk/invoice-templates/?c2c=bm14164m "Crunch's free invoice templates")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[![Free editable PDF invoice templates](http://benrmatthews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-06-at-16.17.08-720x358.png)](href=)

Crunch’s range of sleek, simple invoice templates are created especially for freelancers, contractors and small business owners.

These templates include options for VAT and are even editable in Excel or Google Drive.

***If you’re looking for an accountant, [I recommend Crunch’s freelance accounting services as well](http://www.crunch.co.uk/referrals/?c2c=bm14164m "Crunch").***

[Invoice to me](http://invoiceto.me/)

![Invoice to me](http://benrmatthews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-06-at-16.01.32-720x479.png)

One of the free invoice generators that doesn’t seem to be trying to sell you another service, Invoice To Me lets you create and send professional looking PDF invoices online. Plus it automatically calculates taxes and totals for you.

Simple and free, with no advertising or attempts to upgrade you to a paid service, which is quite refreshing after looking through the others.

### Invoice At Once

![Invoice at once](http://benrmatthews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-06-at-16.10.42-720x357.png)

InvoiceAtOnce.com is a 100% free, no registration needed online invoice generator for freelancers.

You don’t need an account and it comes with added features compared to Invoice To Me. For example, you can upload your company logo, choose currency, types and colours.

Probably the nicest looking freelance invoice template and they’re not trying to upgrade you to another freelance service, although the site does carry advertising.

### [Invoiced Lite](https://invoice-generator.com/)

![Invoiced Lite](http://benrmatthews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-06-at-15.59.57-720x401.png)

Invoiced Lite generates quick, attractive invoices that you can print and email, for free.

Invoiced Lite gives you the ability to save invoices inside of your browser’s local storage, eliminating the need for an account, meaning you generate invoices straight from the landing page.

You can also upgrade to Invoiced.com’s unlimited package, which lets you accept credit card payments online from your customers, using payment processors like Stripe and Paypal.

### [Freshbooks’ free invoice generator](https://www.freeinvoicecreator.com/)

![Freshbooks free invoice generator](http://benrmatthews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-06-at-15.58.51-720x425.png)

<div class="explanation-text">Create, download, and send professional invoices with Freshbooks’ free invoice template and get paid hassle-free.

If you’re a freelancer, consultant or small, but growing company, Freshbooks’ invoice generator helps you create professional looking invoices.

</div>### [Paydirt’s free Invoice Template](https://paydirtapp.com/free_invoice_creator)

![Paydirt's free invoice generator](http://benrmatthews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-06-at-16.06.16-720x388.png)

A freelance invoice generator that’s so good, it even makes one of their freelance clients “not hate invoicing”.

Much the same as the other freelance invoice generators, but you can upgrade to the full Paydirt app and it will help you to track payments, accept credit cards, and be automatically notified of late invoices.

A great feature is that Paydirt can create invoices in <span class="tooltip">47 currencies</span> and <span class="tooltip">16 languages.</span> Need to send a Rechnung, or a Facture? Paydirt has got you covered.
