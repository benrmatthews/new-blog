<span style="font-weight: 400;">From those to whom much is given, much is expected. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philanthropic giving is an outstanding way of expressing your appreciation to the customer base providing the support your business needs to thrive and grow. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s more, according to the [Journal of Consumer Research](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/209515?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) demonstrating social consciousness gives your customers the impression your products are of exceptional quality. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These are just two of the ways philanthropy and ecommerce can be good for one another. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some others.</span>

**Incites Customer Loyalty**
----------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If your customers know a percentage of every dollar they spend with you goes to support a charity in which they believe, they’re </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">more likely to buy from you</span>](https://medium.com/ama-marketing-news/how-being-more-charitable-can-enhance-customer-loyalty-sales-and-the-brand-d555d037a12b)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> than a competitor who does not—even if your price is higher. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategic giving also tells shoppers your values align with theirs, which again leads to more customer loyalty. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This can save you from having to participate in a race to the bottom, should a price war break out in your category. </span>

**Brand Reputation Boost**
--------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if people don’t shop with you, they’ll respect your brand when you’re known for giving. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to differentiating your business from the others in your sector, you’ll be perceived as more trustworthy and your ethics are less likely to be called into question. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The logic goes, you must be a good company if you’re giving up some of your profit to help people who are less fortunate than you.</span>

**Encourage Direct Donations**
------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to giving on your own, you can encourage visitors to your site to donate directly to the charity through your web portal. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with your primary site, you can establish one specifically for giving. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The design can be had at no charge when you take advantage of the offerings of one of the many </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">free ecommerce website</span>](https://themes.shopify.com)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> theme providers out there—like Shopify for example.</span>

**Reduced Tax Liability**
-------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Donations to qualified organizations have the potential to reduce your taxable income, thereby lowering your </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">tax bill</span>](https://benrmatthews.com/register-freelance-consulting-business-uk-quickly-cheaply-legally/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Event fees and parking costs, as well the money spent on travel related to charitable giving all qualify. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, you have to make sure the organization you choose qualifies as a charitable organization by the IRS. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to donate either cash or property. You must also itemize your taxes and get a record of the contribution from the charitable entity. The documentation provided should always state the amount and date of the contribution.</span>

**Motivates Employees**
-----------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People feel good about working for companies with socially conscious philosophies that actually give. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People employed by businesses that support charities are also more </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">proud of where they work.</span>](https://www.triplepundit.com/2014/04/corporate-philanthropy-key-employee-engagement/)

<span style="font-weight: 400;">They have also been proven to be more productive, more highly motivated and more committed to working toward the success of the organization. </span>

**Promotes Year-Round Giving**
------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just about every company out there seems to suddenly develop “a heart” during the holiday season. Far from panning such organizations, we laud them for any effort they put forth. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It remains to be said companies who walk the talk all year long tend to benefit more. It’s just seen as a more sincere effort. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Far from an attempt to chide those who show up during the holidays, this is more an effort to commend those who know a hungry child needs to eat every day of the year—in addition to the winter holidays. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philanthropy and ecommerce can absolutely work together to improve the way people live. It also makes it easier for consumers to engage in charitable acts, even as they satisfy their needs and wants in the marketplace. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve yet to engage in benevolent giving, now is as good a time as any to start. </span>
