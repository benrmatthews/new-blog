<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4198" class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_4198" style="width: 750px">![Advantages and disadvantages of freelancing](https://freetrain.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ittqjs3upoy-1024x684.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-4198">*There are any advantages to freelancing – but several downsides too.*</figcaption></figure>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Freelancing can give you a huge range of benefits, which makes becoming a freelancer such an attractive option compared to being employed. Higher pay, improved professional satisfaction and greater flexibility are just some of the benefits of freelancing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, freelancing does not suit everyone, as there are some challenges associated with starting and running your own freelancer business. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But, with the right support, none of these challenges are insurmountable and you will find that finding new work, keeping your skills fresh and taking care of freelance business admin becomes easier.</span>

**Advantages of becoming a freelancer**
---------------------------------------

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased earnings</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You should find that you benefit from increased earnings in two ways: you are paid more per hour /day than an equivalent employee, and your tax status enables you to take home more net pay than an employee.</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Great variety of work</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most freelancers list variety as the number one benefit of freelancing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You choose your assignments and clients, so you can choose only to work on projects that interest you</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Flexibility</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Employees typically must turn up to work between set hours, 9-5 (at least!) five days a week, with limited time off.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Freelancers can choose when to work and when not to, and many have greater control over working hours and locations.</span>

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4199" class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_4199" style="width: 750px">![Advantages of freelancing](https://freetrain.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/q35ntgjpcjw-1024x683.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-4199">*Choosing exactly when you go on holiday is a real advantage of freelancing!*</figcaption></figure>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Holidays</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you are between [freelance work](https://freetrain.co/freelance-work/), you can choose to take as much or as little time off as you like. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, because you are earning more, you have to work less to make the same amount of money as when you were employed.</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop new skills</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You choose which skills to develop and what training you take. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most freelancers find they gain much greater satisfaction, and return on financial investment, when they are in control of their own skills development.</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ditch the office politics</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Freelancers are independent from their clients, and do not become line managers. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You no longer have to schmooze your boss for that promotion / pay rise / week off / training course / flexitime – you are your own boss! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no pressure for you to put in excessive hours (you get paid by the hour / day), work weekends (unless paid) or strive for promotions to secure wage increases.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want more money, you can choose a better paid freelance gig.</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Improved work / life balance</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is amazing how much better many people feel when they have control over their own destiny. As a freelancer, that’s what you will have. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you plan to use your increased earnings to subsidise taking the school holidays off with your kids, or learning to sail, that’s your choice. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If work is everything to you, then you can spend all 52 weeks of the year in contract, which is your choice.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For many workers, freelancing is the answer to their work and lifestyle prayers. You can continue to perform a role that you love, train and develop your skills at your own pace, and choose when and where you work.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But freelancing does not suit everyone. You must acquire a whole set of expertise to ensure that you stay in contract, earn the highest [freelance rates](https://freetrain.co/freelance-rates/), keep your skills fresh and run your freelancing business compliantly and efficiently.</span>

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4200" class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_4200" style="width: 750px">![Disadvantages of freelancing](https://freetrain.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/snsnshlhvpi-1024x566.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-4200">*There are many disadvantages of freelancing – make sure you’re aware before you make the leap.*</figcaption></figure>

**Disadvantages with freelancing**
----------------------------------

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying in work</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to find and secure an ongoing stream of [freelance work](https://freetrain.co/freelance-work/) to ensure you continue to earn enough to make a living. This may require you to engage with [recruitment agencies](https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=recruitment+agencies) and learn the skills they require, or you may need to invest in sales and marketing direct to clients.</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Downtime between freelance work</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are not working then you don’t get paid. But by learning freelancing skills and keeping your technical skills up-to-date, downtime should be minimised.</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Skills and development</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a freelancer, you no longer have a human resources department or talent management team on hand to ensure you are properly trained and qualified to fulfil the roles you deliver. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some freelancers find this liberating, others a chore.</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Safety net</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You no longer have an employer who will continue to pay you if you are ill, or offer benefits such as medical insurance or a pension. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You must take responsibility for each of these aspects of [your physical and financial wellbeing](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/dec/08/i-felt-vulnerable-freelancers-on-the-stress-of-self-employment).</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Holidays</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Freelancing is not like employment, when you receive paid holidays. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t work, you don’t earn. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What you should find, though, is that you are earning so much more that you can afford to take time off.</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Time spent running your freelance business</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two main models of freelancing: [running a limited company](https://www.gov.uk/running-a-limited-company) or [being a sole trader](https://www.gov.uk/set-up-sole-trader). Each of these requires a degree of time spent on administration. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On balance, though, admin time is being constantly reduced as freelancing service providers develop new tools allowing you to minimise the time you spend running your freelance business.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Still thinking of making the leap into freelancing? If you have not done so yet, check out our online [freelance training courses](https://freetrain.co/courses/), which will provide you with the skills and knowledge you need for your freelance business.</span>
