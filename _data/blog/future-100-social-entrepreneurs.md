You might have heard this already via the [Bright One blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20110103100536/http://brightone.org.uk/bright-one-included-in-the-future-100-young-social-entrepreneurs-of-the-year), but this week it was announced that I’ve included as of the [Future 100 Young Social Entrepreneurs of the Year](http://web.archive.org/web/20110103100536/http://www.stridingout.co.uk/latest-news/future-100.html).

The Future 100 Awards puts the spotlight on young people aged 18-35 who are demonstrating entrepreneurial flair and innovation in running a responsible business venture; one which demonstrates a balance between economic, environmental and social goals to achieve ultimate business success.

Here’s a complete list of the Future 100: http://www.stridingout.co.uk/latest-news/future-100

I’ve also created a list of the Future 100 on Twitter:<http://twitter.com/benrmatthews/>

Although it’s my name up there, I just wanted to say to all of Bright One’s volunteers and supporters that this is an award for all of us at Bright One to share, as without their enthusiasm, energy and dedication, Bright One wouldn’t be in the position it is today, helping the charitable organisations we we work with.

Many congratulations to the other people included in the Future 100!
