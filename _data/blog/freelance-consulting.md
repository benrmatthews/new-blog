Freelance digital marketing social media consultant for hire in London, with over 10 years experience in the tech, mobile, government, charity and startup sectors. I started my social career in the financial sector, moving to technology, government and charity social media agencies, before finally working as a freelance social media consultant.

I offer a wide range of social media consultancy services, from social media strategy and community management through to campaign measurement and social media training. Though based in London and often work with client’s in their offices, I run social media campaigns for organisations across the world.

My approach to social media consultancy is to provide an honest, flexible and results-driven service.

I am available for work. [Contact me now](mailto:ben@montfort.io).

<span id="How_I_can_help_you">**How I can help you:**</span>

- On a project basis (one-off projects lasting from a few weeks to a few months) or on a retained basis (ongoing work with an agreed notice period)
- Under my own name (Montfort – the boutique social media agency I run) or under your company name (perfect for social media agencies looking for support)
- In your office (I appreciate that sometimes you want your consultant to be seen and work directly with your team) or remotely (that said, I do sometimes like to work from home)
