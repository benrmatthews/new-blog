</div>### <span id="What_made_you_decide_to_go_freelance">What made you decide to go freelance?</span>

Two months after graduating from University, I was lucky enough to get a job at a small software company, 5 minutes away from home. A few months in though, it was clear to me that it wasn‚Äôt for me. I don‚Äôt like office politics, working 8-5 and working on things that I didn‚Äôt feel passionate about. Soon enough, I had taken the decision to start planning my exit.

### <span id="What_steps_did_you_put_in_place_before_you_went_freelance">What steps did you put in place before you went freelance?</span>

My plan was to start saving a portion of my salary every month and freelance a bit on a side while I get a solid emergency fund until I start getting serious income from my freelancing business.

I started reading everything I could on freelancing, getting clients, managing a business and so on.

My plan worked for a couple months, and I had saved close to ¬£1000; a decent amount, but a solid emergency fund it was not. Around the third month in though, it was obvious to me that working 9-10 hours a day and then coming home to put another 2-3 hours in side projects while having a relationship wasn‚Äôt as easy as I would have hoped.

Still, having my eyes on the prize, I tried to keep at it. After all, the sooner I have enough money, the sooner I can finally do what I wanted and go freelance full-time.

On a sunny Friday afternoon though, an ‚Äúincident‚Äù at work was the final push. I decided that I would put in my resignation and would have to make it work with what I had saved. Sure enough, on Monday morning I put in my resignation and was finally free to do what I wanted to do.

### <span id="How_did_it_feel_before_you_went_freelance">How did it feel before you went freelance?</span>

Exciting. I‚Äôm not risk-averse. Not by a long shot, so I was really excited to finally start doing what I always wanted.

### <span id="How_does_it_feel_now_you_are_freelance">How does it feel now you are freelance?</span>

Awesome! Even though it hasn‚Äôt been that long, I honestly thing it was the best decision of my life. *Err, sorry honey. I meant the second best decision of my life!*

### <span id="What_are_the_positives_of_freelance_life">What are the positives of freelance life?</span>

Freedom. You‚Äôre free to work whenever you want to, on whatever projects you like and with the people you like working with.

### <span id="What_are_the_negatives_of_freelance_life">What are the negatives of freelance life?</span>

**1. It can be stressful.**  
Depending on one‚Äôs financial situation, knowing that you‚Äôre not going to make meets end at the end of the month if you don‚Äôt find a client soon, can be nerve-racking. I was/am lucky enough to have the support (both emotional and financial!) of my SO to make things way, WAY easier.

**2. It can be lonely.**  
Working alone from home gives you freedom but it can also be lonely at times.

**3. Achieving a work/life balance.**  
If you‚Äôre not careful, you might find yourself working 12-16 hours a day, especially if you have clients from all over the world.

### <span id="Any_advice_for_others_looking_to_go_freelance">Any advice for others looking to go freelance?</span>

Make sure this is what you want to do. If you are absolutely sure, try and find ways to minimise risk: Save up some money.Lower your expenses. If you can, start looking for work on the side.

Build relationships with clients.

Get a few testimonials and try to start working towards a solid portfolio.

Or just do what I did, and jump in with both feet üôÇ

It worked for me so I‚Äôm sure that if you work hard enough and put your mind to it, it will work for you too.
