<span style="font-weight: 400;">We live in uncertain times. But one thing has stayed constant – the rise of the freelance workforce. Freelancers are more prevalent now than they have ever been before, and their rise shows little sign of slowing down.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are well [over 2 million freelancers](https://freetrain.co/freelance-statistics/) now plying their trades in the UK and they’re making quite a difference.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Freelancers are a group who fully embrace the challenges that come with autonomy – hard work, [networking](https://freetrain.co/lessons/how-to-make-new-contacts-through-networking/), the delicate dance that comes with retaining existing clients whilst also attempting to acquire new ones.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But the independence doesn’t come without its downsides. Whether that’s managing multiple accounts, signing [contracts](https://freetrain.co/product/freelance-contract-template/), chasing late payments, or simply trying to communicate your ideas to sceptical clients – the logistical and administrative side of freelance life can sometimes be a little overwhelming.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why it’s essential for freelancers to find solutions to issues that might trouble – [freelance insurance](http://bit.ly/BMDinghy), for example. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having the right insurance cover in place offers the peace of mind that comes with being protected.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding the right insurance provider to protect yourself against potential risks and safeguard your all-important reputation, as well as understanding what it is that you do, shouldn’t be a hassle.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why Ben, Rob and Ed built [Dinghy](http://bit.ly/BMDinghy). Online insurance for freelancers, by freelancers. The goal? To make the lives of freelancers easier within a matter of seconds, allowing them to get on with what they do best.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But when it comes to insurance, what do freelancers actually need?</span>

**What insurance do freelancers need?**
---------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re a developer or a creative, an influencer or an IT consultant there are three key insurance policies that freelancers typically need.</span>

###  **Professional Indemnity**

> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new”. – Albert Einstein</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re great at what you do. You know that. We know that. But it doesn’t mean that you won’t make a mistake occasionally. It happens to us all.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it’s a design error like leaving a copyright protected placeholder image in a flyer, to writing code that ultimately doesn’t work the way it’s supposed to, your mistakes can cost your client money if they subsequently have to correct them. Luckily, that’s where Professional Indemnity insurance comes in.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It may well be the case that you’ve done nothing wrong, but even then you’ll still need to defend yourself. The costs associated with doing so, including finding the time to find the right lawyers, can spell disaster for a freelancer – especially if your client is significantly bigger than you and is willing to look for compensation using their own lawyers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dinghy’s [Professional Indemnity insurance](http://bit.ly/BMDinghy) will come to your defence with expert lawyers ready to fight your corner and clear your name. And if you ultimately lose out? Even then, the costs are still covered as part of your claim.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Think you might need this? Learn more about what it covers </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span>](http://bit.ly/BMDinghy)<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

### **Public Liability**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most freelancers are, at some point, likely to meet with clients, work in a shared workspace, or interact with others while working. For those reasons alone, Public Liability insurance is important.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To put it simply: it covers you if you do something that accidentally harms them or damages their equipment.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, if you’re sat in a café and you plug your laptop in, and someone trips over your cable and gets hurt, Public Liability insurance is there to help them (quite literally) get back on their feet.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Think you might need this? Learn more about what it covers </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span>](http://bit.ly/BMDinghy)<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

###  **Business Equipment Insurance**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For most freelancers, contractors and self-employed professionals, your laptop is your Swiss Army Knife. It does everything you need. Without it, it’s difficult to carry on with work.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With your phone, your camera, your tablet and any other gadget you choose to carry, you are essentially a walking, talking office.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But what would happen if it all got stolen? And what would happen if you were working overseas at the time?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having [Business Equipment Insurance](http://bit.ly/BMDinghy) in place will ensure you are back up and running as soon as possible – whether that’s by sending you a physical replacement or via an instant cash transfer.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At Dinghy, our Business Equipment insurance claims handlers are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and will aim to deliver you your replacement equipment within 24 hours of your claim being accepted.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If that’s not possible, then they will offer an instant cash transfer. Not bad, right?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Think you might need this? Learn more about what it covers </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span>](http://bit.ly/BMDinghy)<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

**And a little something extra if you’re a Dinghy customer…**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you buy cover with Dinghy – whether it’s Professional Indemnity, Public Liability or Business Equipment Insurance (or all of them together) – we’ll give you our exclusive Freelancer Assist cover for free.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Freelancer Assist will chase your unpaid invoices, support you with tax investigations (including IR35), provide legal and tax advice, offer a free counselling service and more – with cover up to £100,000.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find out more right </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span>](http://bit.ly/BMDinghy)<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

**What should you look out for when it comes to choosing an insurance provider?**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some providers, like Dinghy, don’t charge admin fees on their policies. Whether you want to change your address, or change your policy, you won’t pay anything more in admin.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dinghy is the only insurance provider to offer on-demand policies to freelancers so that you can maintain your full insurance protection when you’re working and save money when you’re not (without cancelling your insurance and losing all the insurance you’ve just paid for.)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You also don’t have to spend hours on the phone listening to jargon and sales spiel, or just sitting on hold. With an online self-service area, you can change your insurance policy whenever you like.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With Dinghy, insurance, for the first time, is geared toward freelancers with flexible hours operating from changing work environments. Freelancing is the future of work, and Dinghy is the future of insurance. We make a good team.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dinghy is a great option for all of your freelancer insurance needs.
