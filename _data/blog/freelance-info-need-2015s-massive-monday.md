Today is [\#MassiveMonday](https://twitter.com/hashtag/massivemonday "#massivemonday"), the most popular day of the year for people looking for a new career, according to [Metro](http://metro.co.uk/2014/01/05/massive-monday-the-most-popular-day-to-look-for-a-new-job-4250000/) and [the Times](http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/article1359248.ece). For many, Massive Monday is a time that they seriously think about going freelance and they’ll be looking for freelance info to help them make the jump to freelancing.

If you’re thinking the same, then you should use your Massive Monday to get the ball rolling. But what is freelancing actually like? And how do you find work, win clients and get paid?

To get to the bottom of what it’s actually like to freelance, [PolicyBee](https://www.policybee.co.uk/blog/8031/massive-monday-thinking-freelancing "PolicyBee") ran a survey of 2,000 freelancers. Here’s what they found:

- 17.3% revealed they had problems with accounting or other paperwork
- 41.8% of our freelancers had experienced problems finding clients at some point.
- Two thirds of freelancers spent more time at work than their full time employed equivalents.

That’s a lot of challenges.

To help address these challenges, I’ve pulled together the best articles on freelancing in the past year, containing tips, ideas and advice from some of the best of the best from the freelancing world.
