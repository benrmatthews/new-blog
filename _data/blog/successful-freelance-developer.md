Make sure that the solutions are rich with every factor and feature to provide a good experience for the client and targeted audiences. Make use of your efforts, talents, and creativity to its maximum to make the work something different from others and make the client feel it. This is one of the best things you can do from your end to increase the volume of projects and clients.

Stick to your freelance goals
-----------------------------

Never forget the goals that inspired you to work as a freelance developer once you get a project. Always remember those factors and goals since they act as the best form of motivation and inspiration and help you a lot in personal brand building. This is the best way to stay connected with the valuable clients and create your own space in the freelance platform among others. Never lose the thrill once you get a project and it is the reason why most of the freelancers yet remain as XYZ in the field.

Share your success stories
--------------------------

Once you have completed your project successfully, and the client is happy with the solution and services, share your story with others. Even though it is not of top priority, it is really beneficial in different ways. Present day clients show interests in spending some time on the success stories of the freelancers before selecting them. Sharing the story is one of the best ways to promote personality to the targeted audiences to make deep connections.

Learn to say no
---------------

It is really tough to say no when you were offered with a project. But keep in mind that better opportunities will come mostly at later stages in freelance sectors. So, don’t take everything thrown at you to keep yourself engaged. This prevents you from taking a better opportunity when it knocks at you. Don’t be too occupied and always have some bandwidth for better opportunities. Hence, select the opportunities wisely to keep yourself engaged without more tensions.

Understand the importance of your health
----------------------------------------

Health is the best form of asset for freelance workers. Most of the freelancers keep them packed with several projects to have sleepless nights in the beginning. This is not good since good health is essential for freelancers. Try to limit your working for around 8 to a maximum of 10 hours per day instead of 15 to 16 hours. This helps you to stay in freelance sectors for an elongated period. Good sleep is extremely important to start the work with a fresh and energetic mind in the next day morning.

Manage your freelance finances well
-----------------------------------

Time and life can change very fast. So, try to achieve financial freedom to become a successful freelancer in real sense.

Treat your freelance work as your favorite job and show real commitment. There is no doubt the more you respect your work, the more will be your returns. Save as much amount as you can with perfect finance management.
