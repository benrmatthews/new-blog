*This is a guest post by Zoe Bowring from [<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dinghy</span>](http://bit.ly/bendinghy).*

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As freelancers you’re putting yourself out there more than ever. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are about 2 million freelancers now in the UK and, for the most part, you’re loving it. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[A happiness survey](https://www.a-connect.com/acknowledge/happiness-survey/) reported </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that you are ‘3x more likely to be extremely happy if you’re self employed’. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Freelancers fully embrace the challenges and independence of working hard, networking, juggling and retaining existing clients whilst acquiring new ones. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But with this independence comes the stress of managing your accounts, signing contracts, getting paid on time and even defending your work from unhappy clients… this admin can be overwhelming. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why finding good solutions for all of your pressure points, </span>**including insurance**<span style="font-weight: 400;">, will position you to become even happier with the path you’ve chosen. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding the </span>**right insurance provider**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to protect yourself against potential risks and safeguard your all-important reputation doesn’t need to be a hassle. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why Ben, Rob and Ed built </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dinghy</span>](http://bit.ly/bendinghy)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> online insurance for freelancers – to make your lives easier in a matter of seconds – so you can get on with what you do best. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, [a recent US survey](https://cakeandarrow.com) reported that ‘those \[freelancers\] with insurance seemed to be the happiest’,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">so getting the right insurance really is a win-win.</span>

**What insurance do freelancers need?**
---------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re a developer, creative, influencer, consultant, IT contractor, photographer, editor, marketeer, designer, (the list goes on…!), there are 4 insurance policies that freelancers typically need.</span>

![Professional Indemnity Insurance](../uploads/2018/01/Professional-Indemnity-Insurance.png)

### **1. Professional Indemnity**

*<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new”. – Albert Einstein </span>*

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may never imagine you’ll ever make a mistake, but let’s face it, we’re all human. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">From design errors such as leaving a copyright protected placeholder image in a flyer, to writing code that ultimately doesn’t work the way it’s supposed to, your mistakes can cost your client money to get right; and that’s where Professional Indemnity insurance comes in. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you don’t believe you have done anything wrong, the cost of defending yourself, including the time to find the right lawyers, can spell disaster for a freelancer. Especially if your client has more clout than you and is willing to look for compensation using their own lawyers. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dinghy’s Professional Indemnity insurance will provide your defense with expert lawyers ready to fight your corner and clear your name. And if you ultimately lose out, the costs are still covered as part of your claim. </span>

### ![Public Liability Insurance](../uploads/2018/01/Public-Liability-Insurance.png)  
**2. Public Liability**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you meet with clients, work in a shared workspace, or interact with anyone else while working, then you should consider Public Liability insurance. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It covers you if you do something that accidentally harms them or damages their stuff. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, if you’re sat in a café and you plug your laptop in, and someone trips over your cable and gets hurt, Public Liability insurance is there to help them get back on their feet.</span>

### **3. Business Equipment Insurance**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For most freelancers, contractors and self-employed professionals, your laptop is your modern workhorse. Without it, you simply can’t work. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Combined with your phone, camera, tablets and other business equipment you are a mobile office. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What would happen if it was all stolen? What would happen if you were abroad at the time? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurance should ensure you are back up and running as soon as possible, whether that’s by sending you a physical replacement or via an instant cash transfer. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dinghy’s equipment insurance claims handlers are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and will aim to deliver you your replacement equipment within 24 hours of your claim being accepted.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If that’s not possible, then they will offer an instant cash transfer. </span>

### **4. Cyber Insurance**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For freelancers and the self-employed, who regularly travel with portable laptops and emails on their phones holding data about their customers, and even customer’s customers, the risk of losing that data has increased. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, cyber criminals are becoming more aware of the value of this data and increasingly looking for easy targets. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The costs and time involved in a breach response, should one happen, quickly add up. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">From having to notify everyone affected to responding to their questions to even paying regulatory fines – all of these are covered by your Cyber insurance.</span>

**What to look out for when choosing an insurance provider?**
-------------------------------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some providers, like Dinghy, have introduced Zero admin fees to their policies. So whether you want to change your address, or change your policy, you pay nothing more in admin. </span>

[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dinghy</span>](http://bit.ly/bendinghy)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the only insurance provider to offer on-demand policies to freelancers so that you can maintain your full insurance protection when you are working and save money when you are not; without cancelling your insurance and losing all the insurance you’ve just paid for. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You also don’t have to spend hours on the phone listening to jargon, or waiting for an operator. With an online self-service area, you can change your insurance policy whenever you like. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurance, for the first time, is now geared toward freelancers with flexible hours operating from changing work environments. It’s a game-changer for freelancers so take advantage! </span>
