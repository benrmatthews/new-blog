--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Having a child and not wanting to go back to work full-time while children were very small.

<span id="What_steps_did_you_put_in_place_before_you_went_freelance">What steps did you put in place before you went freelance?</span>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Um, nothing really, I’m more of a leap before you look person. Also 10 years ago it wasn’t really obligatory to have a website or whatever, which I’d say it is now.<span style="color: #ff0000;">\*</span>

<span id="How_did_it_feel_before_you_went_freelance">How did it feel before you went freelance?</span>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was slightly worried that I’d miss the office banter and working as part of a team but the nature of PR meant that I was out about fair bit, in addition to always being on the phone. This was pre-twitter remember, seems another world now.

<span id="How_does_it_feel_now_you_are_freelance">How does it feel now you are freelance?</span>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve worked for myself for so long that I can’t imagine being a salaried employee now.

Very occasionally I see a job that tempts me but the flexibility of working for myself outweighs any negatives.

<span id="What_are_the_positives_of_freelance_life">What are the positives of freelance life?</span>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flexibility, variety, control.

<span id="What_are_the_negatives_of_freelance_life">What are the negatives of freelance life?</span>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cash flow, sometimes not getting to work really at depth on something, not working with others in an office (but twitter replaces that for me now anyway).

<span id="Any_advice_for_others_looking_to_go_freelance">Any advice for others looking to go freelance?</span>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contacts are really important, build up (through twitter/Linkedin or whatever) a really good network.

In 10 years of working for myself around 95% of my work has been through recommendation and word-of-mouth.

Also, it’s not as financially scary as I think some people believe. I always take the view that you never know what’s going to happen tomorrow anyway, even in salaried employment.

<span style="color: #ff0000;">\*</span>Yes I know my website is old and unloved looking, a new one is in the works honest.
